<h2 class="space-above">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>I am afraid that this third and last volume of <i>Caroline Poets</i>
must reverse the famous apology of the second of the monarchs
from whom it derives its title. It has been an unconscionable
time in being born; though I do not, to speak in character with
my authors, know what hostile divinity bribed Lucina. I cannot
blame any one else: and&mdash;though for the first ten years after the
appearance of Vol. II I was certainly very busy, professionally and
with other literary work&mdash;I do not think I omitted any opportunity
of getting on with the book. I think I may say that if the time
I have actually spent thereon at spare moments could be put
together it would represent a full year's solid labour, if not more.
I make neither complaint nor boast of this; for it has always
been my opinion that a person who holds such a position as
I then held should, if he possibly can, do something, in unremunerative
and unpopular ways, to make the treasure of English
literature more easily accessible. I have thoroughly enjoyed the
work; and I owe the greatest thanks to the authorities of the
Clarendon Press for making it possible.</p>

<p>But no efforts of mine, unless I had been able to reside in Oxford
or London, would have much hastened the completion of the task:
for the materials were hard to select, and, when selected, harder to
find in copies that could be used for printing. Some of them
we could not get hold of in any reasonable time: and the Delegates
of the Press were good enough to have bromide rotographs of the
Bodleian copies made for me. I worked on these as long as I could:
but I found at last that the white print on black ground, crammed
and crowded together as it is in the little books of the time, was
not merely troublesome and painful, but was getting really dangerous,
to my extremely weak eyesight.</p>

<p>This necessitated, or almost necessitated, some alterations in the
scheme. One concerned the modernization of spelling, which accordingly
will be found disused in a few later pieces of the volume;
another, and more important one, the revision of the text. This
latter was most kindly undertaken principally by Mr. Percy Simpson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[page&nbsp;iv]</span>
who has had the benefit of Mr. G. Thorn-Drury's unrivalled knowledge
of these minors. I could not think of cramping the hands
of scholars so well versed as these were in seventeenth-century
work: and they have accordingly bestowed rather more attention
than had originally formed part of my own plan on <i>apparatus
criticus</i> and comparison of MSS. The reader of course gains considerably
in yet other respects. I owe these gentlemen, who may
almost be called part-editors of this volume as far as text is concerned,
very sincere thanks; and I have endeavoured as far as
possible to specify their contributions.</p>

<p>When the war came the fortunes of the book inevitably received
another check. The Clarendon Press conducted its operations in
many other places besides Walton Street, and with many other
instruments besides types and paper. Nor had its Home Department
much time for such mere <i>belles lettres</i> as these. Moreover the loss of
my own library, and the difficulties of compensating for that loss
in towns less rich in books than Edinburgh, put further drags
on the wheel. So I and my Carolines had to bide our time still:
and even now it has been thought best to jettison a part of the
promised cargo of the ship rather than keep it longer on the stocks.</p>

<p>The poets whom I had intended to include, and upon whom
I had bestowed more or less labour, but who now suffer exclusion,
were Heath, Flecknoe, Hawkins, Beedome, Prestwich, Lawrence,
Pick, Jenkyn, and a certain 'Philander'. Of these I chiefly
regret Heath&mdash;the pretty title of whose <i>Clarastella</i> is not ill-supported
by the text, and who would have 'taken out the taste'
of Whiting satisfactorily for some people&mdash;Hawkins, Lawrence,
and Jenkyn. Henry Hawkins in <i>Partheneia Sacra</i> has attained
a sort of mystical unction which puts him not so very far below
Crashaw, and perhaps entitles him to rank with that poet, Southwell,
and Chideock Tichborne earlier as the representative quartette of
English Roman Catholic poetry in the major Elizabethan age.
Lawrence's <i>Arnalte and Lucetida</i>, not a brilliant thing in itself, has
real literary interest of the historical-comparative kind as representing
a Spanish romance by Diego de San Pedro (best known
as the author of the <i>Carcel de Amor</i>) and its French translation
by Herberay, the translator of <i>Amadis</i>. But such things remain
to be taken up by some general historian of the 'Heroic' Romance.
As for 'Patheryke' [<i>sic</i>] Jenkyn he attracted me many years ago
by the agreeable heterography of his name (so far preferable to more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev" id="pagev"></a>[page&nbsp;v]</span>
recent sham-Celticizings thereof) and held me by less fantastic
merits. Flecknoe pleaded for a chance against the tyranny of
'glorious John'. But when it was a question between keeping
these and the others with further delay and letting them go, there
could not be much doubt in which way England expected this
man to do his infinitesimal duty.</p>

<p>One instance, not of subtraction but of addition to the original
contents, seems to require slight notice. The eye-weakness just
mentioned having always prevented me from making any regular
study of palaeography, I had originally proposed only to include work
already printed. I was tempted to break my rule in the case
of Godolphin: and made rather a mess of it. An errata list in the
present volume (p. <a href="#page552">552</a>) will, I believe, repair the blunder. The
single censurer of this (I further believe) single serious lapse of mine
was, I remember, troubled about it as a discredit to the University
of Oxford. I sincerely trust that he was mistaken. None of us
can possibly do credit to our University; we can only derive
it from her. To throw any discredit on her is equally impossible:
though of course any member may achieve such discredit for
himself. Let me hope that the balance against me for indiscreet
dealing with perhaps one per cent. of my fifteen hundred or two
thousand pages is not too heavy.</p>

<p>Little need be said of the actual constituents of the volume, which
has however perhaps lost something of its intended 'composition', in
the artistic sense, by losing its tail. A good English edition of Cleveland
has long been wanted: and I think&mdash;the thought being stripped
of presumption by the number and valiancy of my helpers&mdash;that we
have at last given one. Stanley and King&mdash;truer poets than Cleveland,
if less interesting to the general public&mdash;also called for fresh presentation.
If anybody demurs to Flatman and still more to Whiting he must
be left to his own opinion. I shall only note here that on Cleveland
I was guilty of injustice to the Library of the University of Edinburgh
(to which I owe much) by saying that it contained no edition of this
reviler of Caledonia. None was discoverable in my time, the process
of overhauling and re-cataloguing being then incomplete. But my
friend and successor, Professor Grierson, tells me that one has since
been found. As to King, I have recently seen doubts cast on his
authorship of 'Tell me no more'. But I have seen no valid reasons
alleged for them, and I do not know of any one else who has the
slightest claim to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[page&nbsp;vi]</span></p>

<p>Of the whole three volumes it is still less necessary to say much.
I have owed special thanks in succession to Mr. Doble, Mr. Milford,
and Mr. Chapman (now Secretary) of the Clarendon Press; to
Professors Firth and Case (indeed, but for the former's generous
imparting of his treasures the whole thing could hardly have been
done) for loan of books as well as answering of questions; and
to not a few others, among whom I may specially mention my
friend of many years, the Rev. William Hunt, D.Litt., Honorary
Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. I wish the work had done
greater credit to all this assistance and to the generous expenditure
of the University and its Press. But such as it is I can say
(speaking no doubt as a fool) that I should myself have been
exceedingly grateful if somebody had done it fifty years ago: and
that I shall be satisfied if only a few people are grateful for it between
now and fifty or five hundred years hence. For there is stuff in it,
though not mine, which will keep as long as the longest of these
periods and longer.<a id="footnotetagpn1" name="footnotetagpn1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotepn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

The tolerably gentle reader will easily understand that, in a book written, and
even printed, at considerable intervals of time, Time itself will sometimes have
affected statements. There may be a few such cases here. But it seems
unnecessary to burden the thing with possible Corrigenda, as to the post-war

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO JOHN CLEVELAND.</h2>

<p>Almost everybody&mdash;an everybody not including many bodies&mdash;who
has dealt with Cleveland since the revival of interest in seventeenth-century
writers has of necessity dwelt more or less on the moral that he
points, and the tale that he illustrates, if he does not exactly adorn it.
Moral and tale have been also generally summarized by referring to the
undoubted fact that Cleveland had twenty editions while Milton's <i>Minor
Poems</i> had two. I do not propose myself to dwell long on this part of
the matter. The moral diatribe is not my trade: and while almost any one
who wants such a thing can deduce it from the facts which will be given,
those who are unable to effect the deduction may as well go without it.
What I wish to provide is what it is not easy for any one to provide, and
impossible for any one to provide 'out of his own head'&mdash;that is to say
an edition, sufficient for reading and for all literary purposes, of the most
probably authentic of the heterogeneous poems which have clustered round
Cleveland's name. Such an edition did not exist when this collection of
Caroline poets was planned, nor when it was announced: nor has it been
supplied since in this country. One did appear very shortly afterwards in
America,<a id="footnotetagijc1" name="footnotetagijc1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it has been of use to me: but it certainly does not make
Cleveland's appearance here superfluous. Had not Professor Case of
Liverpool, who had long made Cleveland a special study, insisted
on my giving him in this collection, and most kindly provided me with
stores of his own material, I should not have attempted the task: and
I still hope that Mr. Case will execute a more extensive edition with the
prose, with the doubtful or even certainly spurious poems duly annotated,
and with apparatus which would be out of place here. It cannot, however,
be out of place to include&mdash;in what is almost a corpus of 'metaphysical'
poetry of the less easily accessible class&mdash;one who has been regarded from
different, but not very distant, points of view as at once the metaphysical
'furthest' and as the metaphysical <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p>Cleveland (the name was also very commonly spelt in his own day
'Cleiveland'<a id="footnotetagijc2" name="footnotetagijc2"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc2"><sup>2</sup></a> and 'Cleaveland', as well as otherwise still) was born at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[page&nbsp;5]</span>
Loughborough, and christened on June 20, 1613. His father, Thomas,
was curate of the parish and assistant master at the Grammar School.
Eight years later the father was made vicar of Hinckley, also provided
with a grammar school, at which John appears to have been educated till
in 1627 he went to Christ's College, Cambridge&mdash;where, of course, the
everlasting comparison with his elder contemporary Milton comes in again
for those who like it. He remained at Christ's for seven years as usual,
performing divers college exercises on public occasions, occasionally of
some importance; took his bachelor's degree (also as usual) in 1631; and
in 1634 was elected to a fellowship at St. John's, proceeding to his M.A.
next year. At the end of his probationary period he did not take orders,
but was admitted as <i>legista</i>&mdash;perhaps also, though the statement is
uncorroborated
officially, to the third learned faculty of Physic. There is
also doubt about his incorporation at Oxford. He served as Tutor and as
Rhetoric Praelector: nor are we destitute of Orations and Epistles of an
official character from his pen. Like the majority of university men at the
time&mdash;and indeed like the majority of men of letters and education&mdash;he
was a strong Royalist: and was unlikely to stay in Cambridge when the
Roundhead mob of the town was assisted by a Parliamentary garrison in
rabbling the University. It was natural that he should 'retire to Oxon.',
and it is probable that Oxford was his head-quarters from 1642 to 1645.
But he does not seem to have been actually deprived of his fellowship at
St. John's till the last-named year, when the Earl of Manchester, whom
(especially as Lord Kimbolton) Cleveland had bitterly satirized, had his
opportunity of revenge and took it.</p>

<p>For Cleveland had already been active with his pen in the Royalist cause,
and was now appointed to a post of some importance as 'Judge Advocate'
of Newark. The Governor was Sir Richard Willis, for whom Cleveland
replied to Leven's summons to surrender. They held the town for
the King from November to May, when it was given up on Charles's own
order. Then comes the anecdote&mdash;more than a hundred years after date&mdash;of
Leven's dismissing him with contemptuous lenity. 'Let the poor fellow
go about his business and sell his ballads.' This, though accepted by
Carlyle, and a smart enough invention, has no contemporary authority,
and is made extremely suspicious by its own addition that Cleveland was
so vexed that he took to strong liquors which hastened his death. Now
Newark fell in 1646 and Cleveland lived till 1658. It would make an
interesting examination question, 'How much must a man drink in a day
in order to hasten his death thereby twelve years afterwards?' And it
must be admitted, if true, to be a strong argument on the side of the good
fellow who pleaded that alcohol was a very <i>slow</i> poison.</p>

<p>He escaped somehow, however: and we hear nothing of his life for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[page&nbsp;6]</span>
another decade. Then he is again in trouble, being informed against, to the
Council of State, by some Norwich Roundheads who have, however,
nothing to urge against him but his antecedents, his forgathering with
'papists and delinquents', his 'genteel garb' with 'small and scant means', and
(which is important) his 'great abilitie whence he is able to do the greater
disservice', this last a handsome testimonial to Cleveland, and a remarkable
premium upon imbecility. He was imprisoned at Yarmouth and wrote a very
creditable letter to Cromwell, maintaining his principles, but asking for
release, which seems to have been granted. Cromwell&mdash;to do him justice
and to alter a line of his greatest panegyrist save one in verse on another
person&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Never <i>persecuted</i> but for gain,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and he probably did not agree with the officious persons at Norwich that
there was much to be gained by incarcerating a poor Royalist poet. But
Cleveland had been at least three months in prison, and it is alleged, with
something more like <i>vera causa</i> in the allegation, that he there
contracted
'such a weakness and disorder as soon after brought him to the grave'.
A seventeenth-century prison was much more likely to kill a man in two
years than 'strong waters' which had already been vigorously applied and
successfully resisted for ten. He died in Gray's Inn, of an intermittent
fever, on April 29, 1658.</p>

<p>Something will be said presently of the almost hopeless tangle of the
so-called editions of Cleveland's <i>Poems</i>. It seems at least probable that
no
single one of the twenty&mdash;or whatever the number is&mdash;can be justly called
authoritative. That he was an extremely popular poet or rather journalist in
verse as well as prose, is absolutely beyond dispute&mdash;the very tangle just
referred to proves it&mdash;and, though it may be excessive to call him the most
popular poet of his time, he may fairly be bracketed with Cowley as joint holder
of that position. Nor did his popularity cease as quickly as Cowley's did&mdash;the
Restoration indeed was likely to increase rather than diminish it; and
the editions went on till close upon the Revolution itself, while there were
at least two after it, one just on the eve of the eighteenth century in 1699
and one near its middle in 1742.<a id="footnotetagijc3" name="footnotetagijc3"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc3"><sup>3</sup></a> Considerably before this, however,
the critics had turned against him. 'Grave men', to quote Edward Phillips
and the <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i>, 'affirmed him the best of English poets', but
not for long. Fuller, who actually admired him, admitted that 'Clevelandizing'
was dangerous; and Dryden, who must have admired him at one
time, and shows constant traces of his influence, talks in the <i>Essay of
Dramatic Poesy</i> of a 'Catachresis or Clevelandism'. In the eighteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[page&nbsp;7]</span>
century he passed almost out of sight till Johnson brought him up for 'awful
exampling' in the famous Life of Cowley: and he has had few advocates
since. Let us, without borrowing from these advocates or attempting
tediously to confute his enemies, deal with the facts, so far as they are
known, of his life, and with the characteristics of the carefully sifted, but in
no sense 'selected', poetry which will follow.</p>

<p>As for his character as a man, the evidence is entirely in his favour. He
was an honest and consistent politician on his own side, and if some people
think it the wrong side, others are equally positive that it was the right.
If (rather unfairly) we dismiss the encomia on his character as partisan,
there remains the important fact that no one on the other side says anything
definite against it. If he was abusive, it certainly does not lie with
anybody who admires Milton to reproach him with that. But the fact is,
once more, that except in so far as there is a vague idea that a cavalier,
and especially a cavalier poet, must have been a 'deboshed' person,
there is absolutely no evidence against Cleveland and much in his favour.
Also, this is not our business, which is with him as a poet.</p>

<p>As such he has been subjected to very little really critical examination.<a id="footnotetagijc4" name="footnotetagijc4"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc4"><sup>4</sup></a>
The result of such as I myself have been able to give him was arrived at
somewhat slowly: or rather it flashed upon me, after reading the poems
several times over in different arrangements, that which gives the serious
and satiric pieces higgledy-piggledy as in the older editions, and that which
separates them, as in 1677 and in Mr. Berdan's American reprint. This
result is that I entertain a very serious doubt whether Cleveland <i>ever</i>
wrote 'serious' poetry, in one sense&mdash;he was of course serious enough in
his satires&mdash;at all. That, on the other hand, he deliberately set himself
to burlesque the 'metaphysical' manner I do not think: or at least (for
rather minute definition is necessary here) I do not think that he executed
this burlesque with any reforming intention or any particular contempt for
the style. Like Butler, whom he in so many ways resembles&mdash;who pretty
certainly owed him not a little, and of whom he was, as has often been pointed
out, a sort of rough copy or spoiled draft&mdash;he was what he satirized in the
literary way, and he caricatured himself. Of course if anybody thinks,
as the <i>Retrospective</i> Reviewer thought, that 'Fuscara' and 'To the State
of
Love' are actually and intrinsically 'beautiful specimens of poetic conception',
he will scout my notion. But I do not think that any one who has done
me the honour even to look into these volumes will think me an
'antimetaphysical',
and I must confess that I can see only occasional poetry here&mdash;only
a caricature of such methods as may be suggested by Donne's 'Bracelet'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page&nbsp;8]</span>
piece, and the best things in Crashaw. It is, for instance, a very tell-tale
thing that there is not, in Cleveland's work, a single one of the lovely lyrics
that enshrine and ennoble the conceits in almost every one else of the
school, from Donne himself to Sherburne. An American critic, defending
Cleveland with the delightful indiscreetness of most defenders, maintains
that these lyrics were failures&mdash;that they were <i>not</i> characteristic of the
time.
Well, let us be thankful that almost everybody down to Kynaston and
John Hall 'failed' in this way not seldom.</p>

<p>But Cleveland never failed in it: and unfortunately it wants a failure or
two at least of this kind to make a poet. To illustrate what I mean, let
me refer readers to Benlowes&mdash;comparison of Cleveland with whom would
not long ago have been impossible except in a large library. Benlowes is
as extravagant as Cleveland, whom (I rather think) he sometimes copied.<a id="footnotetagijc5" name="footnotetagijc5"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc5"><sup>5</sup></a>
But he cannot help this kind of poetic 'failure' from breaking in. Cleveland
can, or rather I should say that he does not try&mdash;or has no need to try&mdash;to
keep it out. In 'Fuscara', eminently; in 'To the State of Love', perhaps
most prettily; in the 'Antiplatonic', most vigorously&mdash;in all his poems more
or less, he sets himself to work to accumulate and elaborate conceits for
their own sake. They are not directly suggested by the subject and still
less by each other; they are no spray or froth of passion; they never
suggest (as all the best examples and many not so good in others do) that
indomitable reaching after the infinite which results at least in an infinite
unexpectedness. They are merely card-castles of 'wit' in its worst sense;
mechanical games of extravagant idea-twisting which simply aim at 'making
records'. It is true that people admired them for being this. It is still
truer that similar literary exercises may be found, and found popular, at the
present day. It is even true, as will be shown later, that it is possible
positively to enjoy them still. But these are different questions.</p>

<p>If Cleveland had little or nothing of the poetry of enthusiastic thought
and feeling, he had not much more of the poetry of accomplished form,
though here also he is exceptionally interesting. His 'Mark Antony'<a id="footnotetagijc6" name="footnotetagijc6"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc6"><sup>6</sup></a> has
been indicated as an early example of 'dactylic' metre. It certainly
connects interestingly with some songs of Dryden's, and has an historical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page&nbsp;9]</span>
position of its own, but I am by no means sure (<i>v. inf.</i>) that it was
meant to be dactylic or even anapaestic.</p>

<p>Cleveland, therefore, was not a great poet, nor even a failure of one: but
he was but just a failure of a very great satirist. Even here, of course, the
Devil's Advocate will find only too much to say against him. Every one
of the pieces requires the editing, polishing, and criticizing which (we know
pretty well) the author never gave to anything of his. Every one suffers from
Cleveland's adoption of the same method which he used in his purely
metaphysical poems, that of stringing together and heaping up images
and observations, instead of organizing and incorporating them. Every
one is a tangled tissue of temporary allusion, needing endless scholiastry
to unravel and elucidate it. It has been said, and it is true, that we find
not a few reminiscences of Cleveland in Dryden. There is even in the
couplet of the older and smaller poet something of the weight, the impetus,
the <i>animosity</i> of that of the younger and greater. But of Dryden's
<i>ordonnance</i>, his generalship, his power of coupling up his couplets into
irresistible column, Cleveland has practically nothing. He has something
of his own 'Rupertismus': but nothing more.</p>

<p>But, for all that, the Satires give us ample reason for understanding why
the Roundheads persecuted Cleveland, and justify their fear of his
'abilities'. He has, though an unequal, an occasional command of the
'slap-in-the-face' couplet which&mdash;as has just been said&mdash;not impossibly
taught something to Dryden, or at least awoke something in him. 'The
Rebel Scot', his best thing, does not come so very far short of the
opportunity which the Scots had given: and its most famous distich</p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Had Cain been Scot, God would have changed his doom,</p>
<p>Not forced him wander, but confined him home,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>was again and again revived till the unpopularity of North with South
Britain flamed out last in Bute's time, a hundred years and more after
Cleveland's. Of course it is only ignorance which thinks that this form
of the couplet was invented by Cleveland, or even in his time. It may be
found in Elizabeth's, and in Cleveland's own day was sporadic; nor did
he himself ever approach such continuous and triumphant use of it as
Dryden achieved only two years after Cleveland's own death. But
there is, so to speak, the 'atmosphere' of it, and that atmosphere
occasionally condenses into very concrete thunderbolts. Unfortunately
he knew no mood but abuse, and such an opportunity as that of the
'Elegy on Laud' is almost entirely lost.</p>

<p>However, such as he is&mdash;in measure as full as can with any confidence
be imparted; and omitting of course prose work&mdash;he is now before the
reader, who will thus be able at last to form his own judgement on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[page&nbsp;10]</span>
a writer who, perhaps of all English writers, combines the greatest
popularity in his own time with the greatest inaccessibility in modern
editions.</p>

<p>Nor should any reader be deterred from making the examination by the
strictures which have been given above on Cleveland's purely poetical
methods and merits. These strictures were made as cautions, and as
a kind of antidote to the writer's own undisguised partiality for the
'metaphysical' style. It is true that Cleveland, like Benlowes, has
something of a helot of that style about him: and that his want of
purely lyrical power deprives his readers of much of the solace of his (if
not of their) sin. But those natures must be very morose, very prosaic, or
at best steeled against everything else by abhorrence of 'False Wit'
who can withstand a certain tickling of amused enjoyment at the enormous
yet sometimes pretty quaintnesses of 'Fuscara' itself; and still more at
those of the 'To the State of Love', which is his happiest non-satirical thing.
From the preliminary wish to be a 'Shaker' to the final description of
Chanticleer as</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>That Baron Tell-Clock of the night,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>the thing is a kind of a carnival of conceit, a fairy-tale of the fantastic.
'To Julia to expedite her Promise' is somewhat more laboured and so less
happy: and the loss of the lyric form in 'The Hecatomb to his Mistress' is
considerable. The heroic couplet squares ill with this sort of thing: but
the octasyllabic admits it fairly, and so 'The Antiplatonic' with its greater
part, and 'Upon Phillis walking' with the whole in this metre, are
preferable. Yet it must be acknowledged that one heroic couplet in the
former&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Like an ambassador that beds a queen</p>
<p>With the nice caution of a sword between,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>is worthy of Dryden. Most of the other <i>seria</i> are but <i>nugae</i>: and
the chief interest of the 'Edward King' epicede, besides its contrast with
<i>Lycidas</i>, is its pretty certain position as model to Dryden's 'Lord Hastings'. But
the two 'Mark Antony' pieces and 'Square-Cap' demand, both from
the point of view of tone and from that of metre, more attention than was
given to them above.</p>

<p>If any one not previously acquainted with the piece or the discussions
about it will turn to the text of 'Mark Antony' and read it either aloud or
to himself, I should say that, in the common phrase, it is a toss-up what
scansion his voice will adopt supposing that he 'commences with the
commencement'. The first stanza can run quite agreeably to the usual
metrical arrangements of the time, thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[page&nbsp;11]</span></p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">

<p>or, in technical language, a decasyllabic quatrain, like <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>
or Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, but with hypercatalexis or redundance in the first and
third lines and occasional trochees for iambics; followed by a batch, rhymed
<i>a a a b c c b</i>, of seven three-foot lines also iambic. This, which as far
as the first quatrain is concerned is very nearly the exact metre of Emily Brontë's
<i>Remembrance</i> and of Myers's <i>St. Paul</i>, suits the second and third
stanzas as well as the first.</p>

<p>When the reader comes to the fourth stanza, or if, like some irregular
spirits, he takes the last first and begins with it, the most obvious scansion,
though the lines are syllabically the same, will be different.</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Now which of these is to be preferred? and which did the author mean?
(two questions which are not so identical as they may seem). My own
answer, which I have already given elsewhere,<a id="footnotetagijc9" name="footnotetagijc9"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc9"><sup>9</sup></a> is that both are uncertain,
and that he probably had each of the rhythms in his head, but confusedly.<a id="footnotetagijc10" name="footnotetagijc10"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[page&nbsp;12]</span></p>

<p>'Square Cap' is much less doubtful, or not doubtful at all, and it may
be thought to prove the anapaestic-dactylic scansion, especially the anapaestic
of 'Mark Antony'. For it will be observed that, even from the
first two verses, you can get no iambic run, except of the most tumbling
character, on the line <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>The problem is scarcely one for dogmatic decision, but it is one of some
interest, and of itself entitles Cleveland to attention of the prosodic kind.
For these pieces are quite early&mdash;before 1645&mdash;and a third, 'How the
Commencement grows new' (q.v.), is undeniably trisyllabic and meant
for some such a tune as the 'Sellenger's Round' which it mentions.</p>

<p>With such a combination of interests, political, historical, poetical (as
regards school and period), and prosodic, it will hardly be denied that
Cleveland deserves his place here. But I must repeat that I am here
endeavouring to deal with him strictly on the general principles of this
Collection, and am in no way trying to occupy the ground so as to keep
out a more elaborate edition. I have had help from my friends Professors
Firth and Case in information and correction of contemporary facts; but
full comment on Cleveland, from the historical side, would nearly fill this
volume: and the problems of the work attributed to him would suffice
for a very substantial bibliographical monograph. Neither of these, nor
any exhaustive apparatus, even of the textual kind, do I pretend to supply.
I simply endeavour&mdash;and have spent not a little time and trouble in
endeavouring&mdash;to provide the student and lover of English literature with
an accessible copy, sufficient in amount and fairly trustworthy in substance,
of a curious and memorable figure in English verse.<a id="footnotetagijc11" name="footnotetagijc11"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteijc11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

It has been said that we ought to adopt this spelling because of its connexion with
a district of Yorkshire, which, before it was ransacked for iron ore, was both wild and

They were both St. John's men; and Benlowes must have been a benefactor of
the College (see Evelyn's <i>Diary</i>) while Cleveland was Fellow. Also Cleveland's
Poems had been published, and again and again republished, years before <i>Theophila</i>
appeared.</p>

The <i>Retrospective</i> eulogist was deeply hurt by Cleveland's parodying this, and of
course drags in Milton once more. 'Could one fancy Milton parodying <i>Lycidas</i>?' Now
there is considerable difference between 'Mark Antony' and <i>Lycidas</i>: nor did
Cleveland, so far as we know, dream of parodying his own poem on King. If Milton
had had the humour to parody some of his own work, it would have been much the
better for him and for us. No doubt Cleveland's actual parody is rather coarse and not
extraordinarily witty: but there is no more objection to it in principle than to Thackeray's
two forms of the 'Willow Song' in <i>Ottilia</i>.</p>

The extraordinary complexity of the editions of Cleveland has been glanced at above.
The following summary will at least give the reader some idea of the facts, and the
two original Prefaces will extra-illustrate these facts with some views of causes. It
need only be added here that the principle of the collection now given is, of course, to
exclude everything that is certainly <i>not</i> Cleveland's: and, in giving what certainly
and probably is his, to arrange the items as far as possible in the order of their publication
in the author's lifetime, though the impossibility of working with an actually complete
collection of all the issues before one may have occasioned some error here. In the
following abstract only the <i>Poems</i> are referred to, as they alone concern us.</p>

<p class="footnote">The original collection is contained in <i>The Character of a London Diurnal</i> [prose]
with several select <i>Poems</i>, London, 1647. This was reprinted in the same year and
the next so often that some admit <i>thirteen</i> different issues (of course, as was usual at
the time, sometimes only 'stop-press' batches with slight changes made in what is
practically the same edition), while no one I think has allowed less than <i>five</i>. There
are substantive additions in several of these, but the singular characteristic of the whole,
and indeed of Cleveland's published <i>Poems</i> generally, is that part of the matter, even
in the very earliest issue, is certainly not his: and that in very early forms these pieces
were coolly headed 'Uncertain Authors'. The extent to which this jumbling and
misattributing went on in the seventeenth century is generally if not very precisely
known from the famous cases of <i>Sic Vita</i> (<i>v. inf.</i>, on Bishop King, &amp;c.), and of the
epitaph sometimes assigned to Browne, more usually to Jonson. Another almost equally
strange, though perhaps not so commonly known, is the assignment of some of the
poems of a writer of position like the dramatist James Shirley to Carew. But
Cleveland must have been rather exceptionally careless of his work during his life,
and he was treated with exceptional impudence (see Williamson's <i>Preface</i>) after his
death. The process went on in 1651, to which two issues are assigned, with three or
four pretty certainly spurious additions, while 1653 and 1654 each saw two more, the
last being printed again in 1656 and 1657. This last was also the last printed in
Cleveland's lifetime.</p>

<p class="footnote">But he was hardly dead when in 1659 two different issues, each of them many times
reprinted, took the most astounding liberties with his name. The first foisted in more
than thirty pieces by Robert Fletcher, the translator of Martial. The other, calling
itself <i>Cleveland Revived</i>, contains the remarkable and perfectly frank explanation, given
below, of the principles on which the work of Mr. Williamson was conducted, and
the critical notions which directed his 'virtuous endeavours'.</p>

<p class="footnote">From the disaster of this singular fashion of building a poet's monument out of the
fragments of other people's work, Cleveland may be said to have never been entirely
relieved. For though twenty years later, in 1677 <i>Clievelandi Vindiciae</i> (Preface and full
title again subjoined) undertook the task and provided a sort of standard (which may,
however, be over-valued), ten years later still, in 1687, the purged collection was reissued
with all the spurious matter from previous ones heaped again on it, and this, with
a fresh reissue (new title-paged and with a pasted-on
finis<a id="footnotetagA" name="footnotetagA"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteA"><big>*</big></a>) in 1699, appear to be the
commonest copies that occur.</p>

<p class="footnote">In such a tangle it is not easy to know how to proceed, and I had made and discarded
several plans before I fixed upon that actually adopted. I have taken the edition of
1653, which, with its reprints almost unaltered to 1657, represents the latest text
current during the author's life and during a full lustrum of that. The contents of this
I have printed, putting its few <i>spuria</i> in italic, in the order in which they there appear.
Next, I have given a few additions from 1677 (the only one of the later accessible
editions which even pretends to give Cleveland, the whole Cleveland, and nothing but
Cleveland) and other sources. As was notified above, complete <i>apparatus criticus</i> is
not attempted in a text with such a history, for this would only suit a complete edition
of Cleveland's whole works: but variants of apparent importance are supplied.
I should add that while I myself have for many years possessed the <i>textus quasi-receptus</i>
of 1677, the exceeding kindness of Mr. Case left on my shelves&mdash;for a time disgracefully
long as far as I am concerned&mdash;copies of 1653 itself, 1654, 1659, 1662 (with the
'exquisite remains' of Dick, Tom, and Harry), 1665, 1668, 1669 (with the letters added),
and the <i>omnium gatherums</i> of 1687 and 1699. The Bodleian copies of the <i>Poems</i> of
1647, 1651, 1653, 1654, 1657, 1659, 1662, 1668, 1669, 1677, 1687 have also been used
to check the collations; and the stitched quartos of <i>The King's Disguise</i> (undated, but
known to be 1647) and the <i>News from Newcastle</i>, 1651. The British Museum broadside
of <i>The Scots' Apostasy</i> has also been collated. Mr. Berdan's edition I have
already mentioned. I have treated the text, as far as modernization of spelling goes,
on the same principles as in preceding volumes.<a id="footnotetagB" name="footnotetagB"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteB"><big>&#8224;</big></a>
</p>

<p class="footnote2"><a id="footnoteA" name="footnoteA"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagA"><big>*</big></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is apparently peculiar to some, perhaps to one, copy. The British Museum,
Bodleian, &amp;c. copies have it not.</p>

<p class="footnote2"><a id="footnoteB" name="footnoteB"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagB"><big>&#8224;</big></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the above Introduction was first written an additional revision of the texts
has been made by Mr. Percy Simpson with assistance from Mr. Thorn-Drury, as
referred to in the General Preface of this volume. There can be no doubt that their
labours, superadded to those of Professor Case, have enabled me to put forth in this
edition a text infinitely superior to any previous one, though my part of the credit is
the least. Yet, after all, I dare say Cleveland remains, as he has been impartially
described, 'a terrible tangle'.</p>

<p>Worthy Friend, there is a saying,
<i>Once well done, and ever done</i>; the
wisest men have so considerately acted
in their times, as by their learned works
to build their own monuments, such as
might eternize them to future ages:
our Jonson named his, Works, when
others were called Plays, though they
cost him much of the lamp and oil;
yet he so writ, as to oblige posterity
to admire them. Our deceased Hero,
Mr. Cleveland, knew how to difference
legitimate births from abortives, his
mighty genius anvilled out what he
sent abroad, as his informed mind
knew how to distinguish betwixt writing
much and well; a few of our deceased
poet's pages being worth cartloads of
the scribblers of these times. It was my
fortune to be in Newark, when it was besieged,
where I saw a few [some] manuscripts
of Mr. Cleveland's. Amongst
others I have heard that he writ of the
Treaty at Uxbridge, as I have been
informed since by a person I intrusted
to speak with one of Mr. Cleveland's
noble friends, who received him courteously,
and satisfied his inquiries; as
concerning the papers that were left
in his custody, more particularly of
the Treaty at Uxbridge, that it was
not finished, nor any of his other
papers fit for the press. They were
offered to the judicious consideration
of one of the most accomplished persons
of our age, he refusing to have
them in any further examination, as
he did not conceive that they could
be published without some injury to
Mr. Cleveland; from which time they
have remained sealed and locked up:
neither can I wonder at this obstruction,
when I consider the disturbances
our author met with in the time of the
siege, how scarce and bad the paper
was, the ink hardly to be discerned
on it. The intimacy I had with Mr.
Cleveland before and since these civil
wars, gained most of these papers
from him, it being not the least of his
misfortunes, out of the love he had to
pleasure his friends, to be unfurnished
with his own manuscripts, as I have
heard him say often. He was not so
happy as to have any considerable
collection of his own papers, they
being dispersed amongst his friends;
some whereof when he writ for them,
he had no other answer, but that they
were lost, or through the often reading,
transcribing, or folding of them, worn
to pieces. So that though he knew
where he formerly bestowed some of
them, yet they were not to be regained.
For which reason, the poems he had left
in his hands being so few, [and] of so inconsiderable
[small] a volume, he could
not (though he was often solicited) with
honour to himself give his consent to the
publishing of them, though indeed most
of his former printed poems were truly
his own, except such as have been lately
added, to make up the volume. At the
first some few of his verses were printed
with the<a id="footnotetagcr2" name="footnotetagcr2"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecr2"><sup>2</sup></a> character of the London
Diurnal, a stitched pamphlet in quarto.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[page&nbsp;16]</span>
Afterwards, as I have heard Mr. Cleveland
say, the copies of verses that he
communicated to his friends, the book-seller
by chance meeting with them,
being added to his book, they sold him
another impression; in like manner
such small additions (though but a
paper or two of his incomparable verses
or prose) posted off other editions,
[whereas this edition hath the happiness
to flourish with the remainder
of Mr. Cleveland's last never before
printed pieces.] I acknowledge some
few of these papers I received [many of
these last new printed papers] from one
of Mr. Cleveland's near acquaintance,
which when I sent to his ever to be honoured
friend of Grays-Inn, he had not
at that time the leisure to peruse them;
but for what he had read of them, he told
the person I intrusted, that he did believe
them to be Mr. Cleveland's, he having
formerly spoken of such papers of his,
that were abroad in the hands of his
friends, whom he could not remember.
My intention was to reserve the collection
of these manuscripts for my
own private use; but finding many
of these I had in my hands already
published in the former poems, not
knowing what further proceedings
might attend the forwardness of the
press, I thought myself concerned, not
out of any worldly [unworthy] ends
of profit, but out of a true affection to
my deceased friend, to publish these
his never [other] before extant pieces in
Latin and English and to make this
to be somewhat [like] a volume for
the study. Some other poems are
intermixed, such as the reader shall
find to be of such persons as were for
the most part Mr. Cleveland's contemporaries;
some of them no less
eminently known to the three nations.
I hope the world cannot be so far
mistaken in his genuine muse, as not
to discern his pieces from any of the
other poems; neither can I believe
there are any persons so unkind, as
not candidly to entertain the heroic
fancies of the other gentlemen that
are worthily placed to live in this
volume. Some of their poems, contrary
to my expectation&mdash;I being at
such a distance&mdash;I have since heard<a id="footnotetagcr3" name="footnotetagcr3"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecr3"><sup>3</sup></a>
were before in print, but as they are
excellently good and so few, the [but
in this second edition I have crossed
them out, only reserving those that
were excellently good, and never before
extant. The] reader (I hope) will
the more freely accept them. Thus
having ingenuously satisfied thee in
these particulars, I shall not need
to insert more; but that I have, to
prevent surreptitious editions, published
this collection; that by erecting
this Pyramid of Honour, I might oblige
posterity to perpetuate their memories,
which is the highest ambition of him,
who is,</p>

This singular production is, in the original, punctuated after a fashion very suitable,
in its entire irrationality, to the sentiments of its writer; but I have taken the liberty
(and no other) of relieving the reader of an additional burden by at least separating
the sentences. The second edition of 1660 shows some alterations which are given
above in brackets.</p>

<p class="footnote">Whether Mr. Williamson was one of the most impudent persons in the world, or
merely (which seems more probable) an abject fool, may be left to the reader to
determine. The thing does not seem to require much, if any, annotation. The author,
I think, is not otherwise known, and the name is common enough. The well-known
Secretary Williamson must have been his contemporary, and may have had some connexion
with our paragon besides that of Cavalier principles. But <i>he</i> was Joseph.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>That we interrupt your more serious
studies with the offer of this piece, the
injury that hath been and is done to
the deceased author's ashes not only
pleadeth our excuse, but engageth you
(whose once he was, and within whose
walls this standard of wit was first set
up) in the same quarrel with us.</p>

<p>Whilst Randolph and Cowley lie
embalmed in their own native wax,
how is the name and memory of Cleveland
equally profaned by those that
usurp, and those that blaspheme it?&mdash;by
those that are ambitious to lay
their cuckoo's eggs in his nest, and
those that think to raise up Ph&oelig;nixes
of wit by firing his spicy bed about
him?</p>

<p>We know you have, not without
passionate resentments, beheld the
prostitution of his name in some late
editions vended under it, wherein his
orations are murthered over and over
in barbarous Latin, and a more barbarous
translation: and wherein is
scarce one or other poem of his own to
commute for all the rest. At least every
Cuirassier of his hath a fulsome dragooner
behind him, and Venus is again
unequally yoked with a sooty anvil-beater.
Cleveland thus revived dieth
another death.</p>

<p>You cannot but have beheld with
like zealous indignation how enviously
our late mushroom-wits look up at him
because he overdroppeth them, and
snarl at his brightness as dogs at the
Moon.</p>

<p>Some of these grand Sophys will not
allow him the reputation of wit at all:
yet how many such authors must be
creamed and spirited to make up his
Fuscara?<a id="footnotetagcv2" name="footnotetagcv2"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv2"><sup>2</sup></a> And how many of their
slight productions may be gigged<a id="footnotetagcv3" name="footnotetagcv3"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv3"><sup>3</sup></a> out
of one of his pregnant words? There
perhaps you may find some leaf-gold,
here massy wedges; there some scattered
rays, here a galaxy; there some
loose fancy frisking in the air, here
Wit's Zodiac.</p>

<p>The quarrel in all this is upbraiding
merit, and eminence his crime. His
towering<a id="footnotetagcv4" name="footnotetagcv4"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv4"><sup>4</sup></a> fancy scareth so high a pitch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[page&nbsp;18]</span>
that they fly like shades below him.
The torrent thereof (which riseth far
above their high water mark) drowneth
their levels. Usurping upon the State
Poetic of the time, he hath brought
in such insolent measures of Wit and
Language that, despairing to imitate,
they must study to understand. That
alone is Wit with them to which they
are commensurate, and what exceedeth
their scantling<a id="footnotetagcv5" name="footnotetagcv5"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv5"><sup>5</sup></a> is monstrous.</p>

<p>Thus they deifie<a id="footnotetagcv6" name="footnotetagcv6"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv6"><sup>6</sup></a> his Wit and Fancy
as the clown the plump oyster when
he could not crack it. And now instead
of that strenuous masculine style which
breatheth in this author, we have only
an enervous effeminate froth offered, as
if they had taken the salivating pill
before they set pen to paper. You
must hold your breath in the perusal
lest the jest vanish by blowing on.</p>

<p>Another blemish in this monster of
perfection is the exuberance of his
fancy. His manna lieth so thick upon
the ground they loathe it. When
he should only fan, he with hurricanos
of wit stormeth the sense, and doth not
so much delight his reader, as oppress
and overwhelm him.</p>

<p>To cure this excess, their frugal wit
hath reduced the world to a Lessian
Diet.<a id="footnotetagcv7" name="footnotetagcv7"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv7"><sup>7</sup></a> If perhaps they entertain their
reader with one good thought (as these
new Dictators affect to speak) he may
sit down and say Grace over it: the
rest is words and nothing else.</p>

<p>We will leave them therefore to the
most proper vengeance, to humour
themselves with the perusal of their
own poems: and leave the barber to
rub their thick skulls with bran<a id="footnotetagcv8" name="footnotetagcv8"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv8"><sup>8</sup></a> until
they are fit for musk. Only we will
leave this friendly advice with them;
that they have one eye upon John
Tradescant's executor,<a id="footnotetagcv9" name="footnotetagcv9"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotecv9"><sup>9</sup></a> lest among his
other Minims of Art and Nature
he expose their slight conceits: and
another upon the Royal Society, lest
they make their poems the counterbalance
when they intend to weigh air.</p>

<p>From these unequal censures we
appeal to such competent judges as
yourselves, in whose just value of him
Cleveland shall live the wonder of his
own, and the pattern of succeeding
ages. And although we might (upon
several accompts) bespeak your affections,
yet (abstracting from these) we
submit him to your severer judgements,
and doubt not but he will find that
patronage from you which is desired
and expected by</p>

<p>Your humble Servants.</p>

Here we get into <i>terra cognita</i> as regards authorship. The editors had been,
both of them, Cleveland's pupils at St. John's. 'J. L.' was John Lake (1624-1689), a
man of great distinction&mdash;at this time Vicar of Leeds and Prebendary of York, later
Bishop, first of Sodor and Man and then of Chichester, who while he held the last-named
see had the double glory of withstanding James II as one of 'the Seven', and of
refusing the Oath to William. 'S. D.' was also a Yorkshire clergyman&mdash;Samuel
Drake&mdash;who had not only studied under Cleveland at Cambridge, but fought under him
at Newark. He became Vicar of Pontefract; but (if the <i>D.N.B.</i> is right in assigning
his death to the year 1673) his work on the great vindication of his tutor must have
been done some time before publication. Francis Turner (1638-1700), of a much
younger generation and an Oxford man, though admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Cambridge
in 1662, had been Master of St. John's College since 1670, and was therefore properly
selected as chief dedicatee. He was destined to be connected with Lake again in
the great actions above noted as Bishop of Ely, and for the last ten years of his life
was an active Jacobite agent.</p>

The description of <i>Cleaveland Revived</i> in the third paragraph is perfectly just, and
'anvil-beater' is an obvious echo-gibe at Williamson's own phraseology. It is less
certain what 'grand Sophys' are specially referred to further on&mdash;but Dryden <i>might</i>
be one.</p>

'Scantling' is used in various senses. Either that of 'rough draft' or, as in
Taylor, 'small piece' would do; but it is at least possible that it is not a noun at all,
but a direct participle from the verb to 'scantle', found in Drayton, and meaning
'to be deficient', 'come short'. Some, however, prefer the sense 'dimension' or
'measurement', which would make it a sort of varied repetition of 'commensurate'.</p>

'Deifie' is of course wrong. 'Defy' is likeliest, and in a certain sense (frequent
in Elizabethan writers) would do; but 'decry' seems wanted.</p>

A common phrase for an earlier 'Banting' regime derived from the <i>Hygiasticon</i>
(Antwerp, 1623) of Leonard Lessius (1554-1624). I owe this information to the
kindness of Dr. Comrie, Lecturer on the History of Medicine in the University of
Edinburgh. The next sentence may, or rather must, be a reference to (in fact, a fling
at) Dryden, <i>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</i> (vol. i, p. 52, ed. Ker, Oxford, 1900), who
censures Cleveland for not giving 'a <i>great</i> thought' in 'words ... commonly received'.
I owe the reminder of this to Mr. Thorn-Drury.</p>

Perhaps I should add a very few words explaining why I have not made this
'authenticated' edition the base of mine. I have not done so because the editors,
excellent as was evidently their intention, have after all given us no reasons for their
exclusions and inclusions; because, though they have corrected some obvious errors,
their readings by no means always intrinsically commend themselves to me; and
especially because the distance between 1647 and 1677 reflects itself, to no small
degree, in a certain definite <i>modernisation</i> of form, grammatical and prosodic. 1653
has much more <i>contemporariness</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the State of Love, &amp;c.</i> appeared first <i>1651</i>. The stanzas are not divided in the
early editions, but are so in <i>1677</i>. Carew's <i>Rapture</i> may have given some suggestions,
Apuleius and Lucretius also; but not much is required. The substance is shocking
to pure prudery, no doubt; but, as observed in the introduction, there is perhaps
more gusto in the execution than in <i>Fuscara</i>.</p>

<p>A copy of this poem, with many minor variants, is in Bodleian MS. Tanner 306,
fol. 424: it has one noteworthy reading, 'took sey', i.e. 'say' or 'assay'&mdash;the hunting
term&mdash;in l. 27.</p>

<p>2, 3 The use of capitals in the seventeenth century is so erratic that it is dangerous
to base much on it. But both 'Seekers' and 'Shakers' (a variant of 'Quakers') were
actually among the countless sects of the time, as well of course as 'Adamites'. <i>1651</i>.
<i>1653</i>, <i>1654</i>, and <i>1657</i> have 'tempt' for <i>1677</i> 'sate'.</p>

<p>4 pants <i>1677</i>: 'pulse' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, <i>1654</i>, <i>1657</i>.</p>

<p>10 'You'd break a Lent' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>11-13 Benlowes's lines (<i>v. sup.</i> i. 356)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The lady prioress of the cloistered sky, &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>are more poetic than these, but may be less original. Even that, however, is uncertain.
Both poets, though Benlowes was a good deal the elder, were of St. John's, and
must, even in other ways, have known each other: <i>Theophila</i> appeared a year after
the edition in which this poem was first included. But the indebtedness may be the
other way, or common to an earlier original, or non-existent.</p>

<p>19 Deals out] The earlier texts have 'Dazzle's', but <i>1677</i> seems here to have
introduced the true reading found also in the <i>MS.</i> 'Deals out' is far more poetical:
the eye clothes with its own reflection sky and stars, and earth.</p>

<p>20-3 The punctuation of all editions, including Mr. Berdan's, makes these lines
either totally unintelligible, or very confused, by putting a stop at 'spectacles' and
none at 'beams'. That adopted in the text makes it quite clear.</p>

<p>30 circle] 'compass' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, evidently wrong.</p>

<p>33 It is not impossible that Aphra Behn had these lines unconsciously in her head
when she wrote her own finest passage. Unconsciously, for the drift is quite
different; but 'hurled', 'amorous', and 'world' come close together in both.</p>

<p>34 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> again 'compass' for 'girdle'.</p>

<p>37 'would', the reading of <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, infinitely better than 'could', that of <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>45 In this pyramidally metaphysical passage Cleveland does not quite play the game.
Mahomet's pigeon did not <i>kiss</i> him. But 'privy seals to take up hearts' is very dear
to fancy, most delicate, and of liberal conceit. So also 'jewels are in ear-rings worn'
below; where the game is played to its rigour, though the reader may not at first see it.</p>

<p>46 his] 'her' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>; but it clearly should be 'his', which is in <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>53 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> read 'Next to those sweets her lips dispense', <i>nescio an melius</i>.</p>

<p>61 her] 'our,' a variant of one edition (<i>1665</i>) is all wrong.</p>

<p>62 Mr. Berdan has strangely misinterpreted 'venter'. The phrase is quite
a common one&mdash;'of the second <i>marriage</i>.' The first kiss comes of lip and lip, the
second of lip and love.</p>

<p>67 pickeering] 'marauding', 'skirmishing in front of an army'.</p>

<p>70 For 'join' [jine] <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> and others have 'whine'&mdash;suggesting the Latin
<i>gannitus</i> frequent in such contexts. But 'join' must be right. Professor Gordon
points out that the passage is a reminiscence of Donne, in his <i>Extasie</i>:</p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>As 'twixt two equall Armies, Fate</p>
<p class="i2">Suspends uncertaine victorie,</p>
<p>Our soules (which to advance their state</p>
<p class="i2">Were gone out,) hung 'twixt her, and mee.(13-16.)</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This is contrasted with the bodily 'entergrafting' of l. 9, &amp;c.</p>

<p>74 When 'prose and sense' came in they were very contemptuous of this Baron
Tell-clock. But the image is complete, congruous, and capable of being championed.</p>

<p>75 'Boutesel' of course = 'boot and saddle', albeit 'boute' does not mean 'boot'.</p>

<p><i>The Hecatomb to his Mistress.</i>] (<i>1651</i>.) This poem is perhaps the best text to
prove (or endeavour to prove) that Cleveland's object was really burlesque.</p>

<p>1 you] 'ye' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>2 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> read 'the' for 'your', and 'splaid': 'spade' <i>1677</i>. 'Spay' or 'splay'
to destroy the reproductive powers of a female.</p>

<p>3 the bastard] <i>1677</i> again alters 'the' to 'your', which does not seem good.</p>

<p>5 sacrilege] sacrifice <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>6 your] their <i>1653</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>7 postillers] The word means glossers or commentators on Scripture, and has
acquired in several languages a contemptuous meaning from the frequently commonplace
and trivial character of such things. 'ye fantastic' <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>9 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> have 'his' for 'her', and in the next line 'his self' for 'herself'.
The poem is particularly badly printed in this group, and I think the <i>1677</i> editors, in
trying to mend it, have mistaken some places. Thus in ...</p>

<p>22 They print 'Would' for 'Should'. This may look better at first; but I at least
can make no real sense of it. With 'Should' I can make some. The poet starts an
extravagant comparison in 19-21; continues it in '[suppose] that Intelligence should',
&amp;c.; finds it will not do, and breaks it off with the parenthetical 'Let me' &amp;c. To
bring this out I have inserted the &mdash;.</p>

<p>24 <i>1677</i> 'And venture', with a full-stop at 'higher', not so well; but in ...</p>

<p>'<i>un</i>decline' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. is nonsense; while in the next line 'sound <i>agen</i>' either
points to a complete breakdown or indicates that, on the most recent Cockney
principles, 'again' could be pronounced 'ag<i>ine</i>' and rhymes <i>à la</i> Mrs. Browning. The
text is <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>28 set] shadow <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>35 define] describe <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>37 perfections <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: perfection <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>43 brief = 'list'.</p>

<p>44 name-sak'd <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>45 the] your <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>52 <i>1677</i>, not nearly so well, 'see and' for 'feel, to'. You want the list of senses
completed and summed up by such a palate in 'see', which, repeated, spoils all.</p>

<p>54 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> have 'his' for 'hers'; but 'a double prize' is more vivid if less strictly
defensible than 'the beauteous' of <i>1677</i>. So in
56 <i>1677</i> opens with 'Seeing each' instead of 'When from'&mdash;much feebler. But in
57-8 The text, which is <i>1677</i>, is better than <i>1653</i>:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Or can the sight be deaf <i>if she but speak</i>,</p>
<p>A well-tuned face, such moving rhetoric?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>which indeed is, if not nonsense, most clumsily expressed, even if comma at 'face' be
deleted.</p>

<p>60 and melts] yet melts <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>66 'sixt' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>70-1 The punctuation of the old texts&mdash;no comma at 'flowers' and one at
'hearse'&mdash;makes the passage hard to understand. As I have altered this punctuation,
it is clear.</p>

<p>73 what Divines] <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. 'with Divines'.</p>

<p>75 come now <i>1677</i>: come, come <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>83 square] squared <i>1677</i>. If all this is not burlesque it is very odd.</p>

<p>85 you undertake not <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p><i>Upon Sir Thomas Martin</i>.] (<i>1651</i>.) We here turn to the other side of Cleveland's
work, where jest and earnest are combined in a very different fashion. Martin was a
member of the Committee of Sequestration appointed under the Act of April 1, 1643,
which, in a more fearless and thoroughgoing fashion than that of some later legislation,
confiscated in a lump the property of certain bishops and of political opponents
generally. The sequestrators for Cambridge were this man and two other knights&mdash;Sir
Dudley North and Sir John Cutts; with two esquires&mdash;a Captain Symonds and
Dudley Pope.</p>

<p>1 'pence apiece' <i>1651</i>, which makes doubtful sense. <i>1653</i>, <i>1677</i>, and all others before
me, have 'pence a piece', which I believe to be careless printing for the text above.
The 'piece' is the same as the 'beast', and the brackets which follow in the originals
are a printer's error. 'Piece', in this sense of 'rare object', is not uncommon.
Cf. Prospero's 'Thy mother was a <i>piece</i> of <i>virtue</i>.' 'Pence apiece' (about the same
as the Scotch fishwife's 'pennies each'), if not, as Mr. Berdan says, 'proverbial',
is certainly a perfectly common expression, still I think existing, but it is difficult to
see how what follows can thus suit it. 'Which' must have an antecedent.</p>

<p>4 'Bartlemew' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: 'Bartholmew' <i>1654</i>. The word was, of course, pronounced
'Bartlemy,' and almost dissyllabically.</p>

<p>5 that outvies] <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'one that outvies', perhaps rightly.</p>

<p>6 Tredeskin <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: Tredescant <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>11 The reference to the animal between two burdens to whom Issachar is biblically
compared (Gen. xlix. 14) is perhaps meant to be additionally pointed by 'Sir <i>Martin</i>',
the latter being one of the story-names of the much-enduring beast.</p>

<p>16 voider] The servant who clears the table; also, but here less probably, the tray
or basket used for the purpose.</p>

<p>18 The 'Poor Knights of Windsor' having fallen, like other institutions, into the maw
of plebeian and Puritan plunder.</p>

<p>19 The hyphen at 'Pair-royal', which Mr. Berdan has dropped, is important,
the term being technical in certain card-games and meaning <i>three</i> cards of the same
value&mdash;kings, &amp;c.</p>

<p>21 trumped on thee = turned thee up like a trump.</p>

<p>22 'Smec'&mdash;of course&mdash;'tymnuus', and used both for the sake of contempt and as
denoting a plurality of person.</p>

<p>24 The principle of this line is of course part of the A B C of the more modern and
dogmatic heraldry: the application will lie either on sword or spur, the two
characteristic insignia of knighthood and both metallic. <i>1677</i> changed 'ill armory' to
'false heraldry', and Scott was probably thinking of this line when he made Prince
John and Wamba between them use the phrase in <i>Ivanhoe</i>.</p>

<p>25 Godfrey's arms as King of Jerusalem&mdash;five golden crosses on a silver shield&mdash;were
commonly quoted, as Cleveland quotes them, in special exception to the rule.
But my friend Mr. F. P. Barnard, Professor of Mediaeval Archaeology in the University
of Liverpool, to whom I owe the materials of this note, tells me that he has collected
many other cases, English and foreign. The objection, however, was originally a
practical one, metal on metal and colour on colour being difficult to distinguish <i>in the
field</i>. It passed into a technical rule later.</p>

<p>29 Priscian's head may not have bled here before it was broken by Butler; but the
dates of the <i>writing</i> of <i>Hudibras</i> are quite uncertain.</p>

<p>31 oaded] This singular word is in all the editions I have seen. <i>1699</i> makes it
'loaded', with no sense that I can see in this passage. Can it be 'oathèd'&mdash;be sworn
either to the commission of the peace or something else that gave the title 'Esquire'?
'Oad', however, = woad; cf. Minsheu, <i>Guide into Tongues</i>, 1617 'Oade, <i>an hearbe</i>. Vide
<i>Woade</i>'. This would certainly suit the next line.</p>

<p>Sir, or Madam, choose you whether!</p>
<p>Nature twists you both together</p>
<p>And makes thy soul two garbs confess,</p>

<p><i>Upon an Hermaphrodite</i>.] (<i>1647</i>.) This poem appeared in the 1640 and all subsequent
editions of Randolph's poems and in the 1653 edition of Beaumont's. Beaumont had
preceded Cleveland as a 'dumping-ground' for odds and ends of all kinds. But see the
following poem.</p>

<p>1 <i>1647</i> and <i>1651</i> 'Madam<i>e</i>', which is not English, and which spoils the run of the
verse.</p>

<p>2 twists] <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, and others 'twist'd', which is very like the time.</p>

<p>10 both sexes] <i>1677</i> and later '<i>the</i> sexes'.</p>

<p>13 I do not know whether it is worth while to point out that catalectic or seven-syllabled
lines with trochaic effect (cf. 9. this, 16, and others), as well as complete
trochaic dimeters (1, 2, &amp;c.), occur more frequently here than in <i>The Senses' Festival</i>,
<i>Fuscara</i>, &amp;c. This, though of course Milton has it, was rather more frequent in
Randolph's generation than in Cleveland's.</p>

<p>22 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1677</i>, and later 'faction', but 'factions' <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>25 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> &amp;c. '<i>It</i> would', which can hardly be right. On the other hand <i>1677</i>
and its follower have '<i>With</i> Regulus his' (l. 26).</p>

<p>31 It can hardly be necessary to interpret this famous and charming phrase.</p>

<p>48 Line shortened to the trochaic run in <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. by dropping 'is'.</p>

<p>52 'Lycomedes' puzzled the earlier printers, who in <i>1647</i> and <i>1651</i> make it 'Nicomedes'
(corrupted by <i>1653</i> to 'Nichomedes')&mdash;a curiously awkward blunder, as it
happens.</p>

<p>56 the left <i>1647</i>, <i>1653</i>: thy left <i>1651</i>.</p>

<p>58 The late edition of <i>1687</i>, when 'regularity' was becoming a fetish, inserted 'all'
before 'alone', though <i>1677</i>&mdash;its standard for the genuine poems&mdash;has not got it, and
it is not wanted.</p>

<p>59 heteroclite part] <i>1677</i> and its followers, puzzled by this, the original, reading,
read 'apart' (apostrophating 'Het'roclite'), the sense of which is not clear; while Mr.
Berdan would emend to 'heteroclitic', which is unnecessary. Cleveland may well
have scanned 'heter&#333;clite', which is by no means an extravagant licence, and has
been paralleled by Longfellow in 'Eur&#333;clydon'. Indeed, since I wrote this note
Mr. Simpson has furnished me with a parallel of 'heter&#333;clite' itself from Harl. MS.
4126, f. 102.</p>

<p>60 but thy heart <i>1649</i>: not the heart <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>62 'But' <i>1677</i>: 'And' in earlier texts.</p>

<p><i>The Author's Hermaphrodite</i>.] (<i>1647</i>.) The note, which appears in all editions, seems
evidently conclusive as to this poem. Moreover the quibbles are right Clevelandish.</p>

<p>7 'main' is a little ambiguous, or may appear so from the recent mention of dice.
But that sense will hardly come in, and Cleveland was probably thinking of the famous
passage in Spenser (Artegall's dispute with the giant, <i>F. Q.</i> v. ii) as to the washing
away and washing up of the <i>sea</i>. Yet 'main' <i>might</i> mean 'stock'. The reading
of 'gets place' in one edition (<i>1662</i>), rather notable for blunders, cannot be listened to.</p>

actual Arabs had been tried.</p>

<p>34 compurgators] persons who swear in a court of law to the innocence or the
veracity of some other person.</p>

<p>35 I was unable to say why the King of Bashan comes in here, except that the comparison
of the <i>Dialogue on the &amp;c.</i>, 'Og the great <i>commissary</i>', and the put case
about 'penance', suggest some church lawyer of portly presence. But Mr. Simpson
and Mr. Thorn-Drury have traced the thing from this point as follows:</p>

<p>Cf. <i>A Dialogue upon the &amp;c.</i>, l. 47 'Og the great commissary', where the copy in
Rawlinson MS. Poet. 26, fol. 94 <i>b</i>, has a marginal note 'Roan'. This was Dr. William
Roan, of whom an account is given in the <i>Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the
British Museum</i>, Division 1, 'Political and Personal Satires', p. 156: 'Dr. Roane
was one of the most eminent doctors who acted in Laud's Ecclesiastical Courts; he fled
from the indignation of the House of Commons, and is frequently alluded to in pamphlets
and broadsides of the time (see <i>Times Alteration</i>, Jan. 8, 1641,... <i>Old News newly
Revived</i>, Dec. 21, 1640,...and <i>The Spirituall Courts Epitomised</i>, June 26, 1641).' The
pamphlet illustrated in this note is <i>A Letter front Rhoan in France Written by Doctor
Roane one of the Doctors of the late Sicke Commons, to his Fellow Doctor of the Civill
Law. Dated 28, of Iune last past. With an Ellegy written by his oune hand upon the

<p>Mr. Thorn-Drury supplies the following references bearing directly on the nickname,
and not noticed in the B.M. Catalogue: <i>Foure fugitives meeting Or, The Discourse
amongst my Lord Finch, Sir Frances Windebank, Sir John Sucklin, and Doctor Roane,
as they accidentally met in France, with a detection of their severall pranks in England.

<p>Suckling says to Roane, 'Hold there good Doctor <i>Roane</i>, and take me with you,
you are to be blamed too, for not bidding farewell to Sir <i>Paul Pinder</i>, (at whose
beauteous house, you have devoured the carkasse of many a cram'd Capon) before you
fled, but I wonder more, why you came hither so unprovided; methinks some English
dyet would have bin good for a weake stomack: the Church-Wardens of Northhamptonshire
promised to give you a good fee, if you will goe to 'em, and resolve 'em
whether they may lawfully take the oath &amp;c. or no.</p>

<p>'<i>Wind</i>. That may very well be, for they have given him a great Addition, they stile
him, Og the great Commissary, they say he was as briske in discharging the new
Canons, as he that made them.'</p>

<p>Suckling addresses Roane as 'Immense Doctor Roane': so it is possible that it was
his personal appearance which suggested the name of Og.</p>

<p>Cf. also <i>Canidia. The Third Part</i>, p. 150 (1683):</p>

<p>Spirits, who 's fit to act, and who to learn,</p>
<p>Who shall be baffled next, who must be beat,</p>
<p>Who killed&mdash;that you may drink, and swear, and eat.</p>

<p>Mere Providence to hear a Compton 's slain.</p>
<p>A name they dearly hate, and justly; should</p>
<p>They love 't 'twere worse, their love would taint the blood.</p>
<p>Blood always true, true as their swords and cause,</p>
<p>And never vainly lost, till your wild laws</p>

<p>Truly durst more than you dare think to do.</p>

<p><span class="right1">30</span>Had entertainment in it, and drew love</p>

<p class="i2">Now you dread Hectors! you whom tyrant drink</p>
<p>Drags thrice about the town, what do you think?</p>
<p>(If you be sober) Is it valour, say,</p>

<p class="i2">Fie! Fie! your lusts and duels both are one;</p>

<p><i>To the Hectors</i> (<i>1653</i>) is struck out in <i>1677</i> and Mr. Berdan does not give it. I asterisk
it in text; but as it might be Cleveland's (though I do not think it is) I do not exclude it.
The Comptons were a good Royalist family in those days. This Henry (not the
Bishop) was killed in 1652 in a duel by George Brydges, Lord Chandos, who died three
years later (see Professor Firth's <i>House of Lords during the Civil War</i>, p. 223).
The fame of the Hectors as predecessors of the Mohocks and possible objects of
Milton's objurgation 'flown with insolence and wine', &amp;c., is sufficient. But they
seem to have been more methodical maniacs and ruffians than their successors, and
even to have had something of the superior quality of Sir Lucius O'Trigger and
Captain M<sup>c</sup>Turk about them, as professors and painful preachers of the necessity and
etiquette of the duel.</p>

<p>2 state duels] Arrange them like the said Captain M<sup>c</sup>Turk in <i>St. Ronan's Well</i>?
word] <i>1653</i> (wrongly for rhyme, though not necessarily for concord) 'words'.</p>

<p>19 booty-souls] Apparently 'souls interested in nothing but booty'. The piece
would seem to have been addressed to Hectors in the actual Cavalier camp, or at least
party. The 'enemies' are of course the Roundheads, and it will soon be noticed that
there is no apodosis or consequence to all these 'who's', &amp;c. It is literally an
'Address' and no more.</p>

<p>25 their] = 'the Comptons'&mdash;nothing to do with 'their' and 'they' in the preceding
lines.</p>

<p><i>Square-Cap</i> (<i>1647</i>) is one of the pleasantest of all Cleveland's poems. Its prosodic puzzle
and profit have been indicated in the Introduction, and it might sometimes run more
easily. But the thorough good-fellowship and <i>esprit de corps</i> carry it off more than
sufficiently. It would be pleasant to think that Mr. Samuel Pepys sang it on the
famous occasion when he was 'scandalously over-served with drink' as an undergraduate.
It had been printed only three years when he went up, though no doubt
written earlier.</p>

<p>2 Cleveland has got the fount right here.</p>

<p>7 she is] she's <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>9 Monmouth-cap] A soldier.</p>

<p>13, 14 A most singular blunder in <i>1677</i> (and the editions that follow it) shows that
Cleveland's 'Vindicators' were by no means always attentive to his sense. It reads
'<i>her</i> grannam' and '<i>She</i> shall have'&mdash;the exact effect of which, as an inducement to
marry him, one would like to hear.</p>

<p>15 la-bee] = 'let-a-be', 'let me alone'.</p>

<p>17 One or two editions (but not very good ones) '<i>Thin</i> Calot'. Calot of course = 'calotte',
the lawyer's cap or coif.</p>

<p>18 This is a signal instance of the way in which these early anapaestic lines break
down into heroics. <i>1677</i> and others read '<i>his</i> pedigree'&mdash;not so well.</p>

<p>22 S. Thomas his leas] A decree of Oct. 29, 1632, ordains that scholars and
students of Corpus and Pembroke shall play football only 'upon St. Thomas Layes',
the site of Downing College later. This decree and the 'S.' of <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, would
seem to show that <i>1677</i> is wrong in expanding to 'Sir', though two Cambridge editors
ought to have known the right name. It was also called 'Swinecroft'. (Information
obtained from the late Mr. J. W. Clark's <i>Memories and Customs</i>, Cambridge, 1909,
through the kindness of Mr. A. J. Bartholomew.)</p>

<h3><a name="page35a" id="page35a"></a>Upon Phillis walking in a morning<br /> before sun-rising.</h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The sluggish morn as yet undressed,</p>
<p>My Phillis brake from out her East,</p>
<p>As if she'd made a match to run</p>
<p>With Venus, usher to the sun.</p>
<p>The trees, like yeomen of her guard,</p>
<p>Serving more for pomp than ward,</p>
<p>Ranked on each side, with loyal duty</p>
<p>Weave branches to enclose her beauty.</p>
<p>The plants, whose luxury was lopped,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Or age with crutches underpropped,</p>
<p>Whose wooden carcasses are grown</p>
<p>To be but coffins of their own,</p>
<p>Revive, and at her general dole</p>
<p>Each receives his ancient soul.</p>
<p>The winged choristers began</p>
<p>To chirp their mattins, and the fan</p>
<p>Of whistling winds like organs played,</p>
<p>Until their voluntaries made</p>
<p>The wakened Earth in odours rise</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>To be her morning sacrifice.</p>
<p>The flowers, called out of their beds,</p>
<p>Start and raise up their drowsy heads;</p>
<p>And he that for their colour seeks</p>
<p>May find it vaulting in her cheeks,</p>
<p>Where roses mix&mdash;no civil war</p>
<p>Between her York and Lancaster.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>
<p>The marigold (whose courtier's face</p>
<p>Echoes the sun and doth unlace</p>
<p>Her at his rise&mdash;at his full stop</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>Packs and shuts up her gaudy shop)</p>
<p>Mistakes her cue and doth display:</p>
<p>Thus Phillis antedates the day.</p>
<p class="i2">These miracles had cramped the sun,</p>
<p>Who, thinking that his kingdom 's won,</p>
<p>Powders with light his frizzled locks</p>
<p>To see what saint his lustre mocks.</p>
<p>The trembling leaves through which he played,</p>
<p>Dappling the walk with light and shade</p>
<p>Like lattice-windows, give the spy</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Room but to peep with half an eye;</p>
<p>Lest her full orb his sight should dim</p>
<p>And bid us all good-night in him,</p>
<p>Till she should spend a gentle ray</p>
<p>To force us a new-fashioned day.</p>
<p>But what religious palsy 's this</p>
<p>Which makes the boughs divest their bliss,</p>
<p>And, that they might her footsteps straw,</p>
<p>Drop their leaves with shivering awe?</p>
<p>Phillis perceived and (lest her stay</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Should wed October unto May,</p>
<p>And, as her beauty caused a Spring,</p>
<p>Devotion might an Autumn bring)</p>
<p>Withdrew her beams, yet made no night,</p>
<p>But left the sun her curate-light.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Upon Phillis, &amp;c.</i> (<i>1647</i>.) This is perhaps the prettiest, as <i>The Senses' Festival</i> is the
most vigorous and <i>Fuscara</i> the most laboured, of Cleveland's Clevelandisms.</p>

<p>6 <i>1677</i> &amp;c. insert 'her' between 'serving' and 'more'&mdash;doubtless on the principle,
noticed before, of patching lines to supposed 'regularity'.</p>

<p>7 'Ranked' <i>1647</i>, <i>1677</i>: 'Banked' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>. As it happens either will do; and at
the same time either, if original, is likely to have been mistaken for the other.</p>

<p>8 'Weave' <i>1647</i>: 'Wave' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: 'Weav'd' <i>1677</i> (the printer unconsciously
assimilating it to the 'Ranked' of l. 8). The same remark applies as to the preceding line.</p>

<p>11 are] were <i>1677</i>, <i>1687</i>.</p>

<p>18 <i>1654</i> 'Un<i>to</i>'.</p>

<p>19 <i>1677</i> &amp;c. 'weaken'd': <i>putide</i>.</p>

<p>20 A meeting-point of many pious poems.</p>

<p>24 <i>1677</i> 'vaulting <i>to</i>'&mdash;hardly an improvement.</p>

<p>26 Dryden may have had Cleveland in mind (as he pretty often, and most naturally
had, seeing that the poems must have 'spent their youth with him') when he wrote
some of the latest and most beautiful of his own lines to the Duchess of Ormond (Lady
Mary Somerset):</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>O daughter of the Rose whose cheeks unite</p>
<p>The differing titles of the Red and White.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>1677</i> '<i>Divides</i> her York and Lancaster'&mdash;pretty palpable emendation to supply the
apparent lack of a verb.</p>

<p>27-30 It has been suggested to me that the sense wants mechanical aid to clear it up;
and I have therefore made a visible parenthesis of 'whose ... shop', following <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>34 thinking] fearing <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>36 <i>1653</i> &amp;c. 'saints'&mdash;a misprint, as <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i> have the singular.</p>

<p>38 Here, for once, Cleveland achieves the really poetical conceit.</p>

<p>42 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. 'bids'&mdash;again a mere misprint.</p>

<p>43 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'would'.</p>

<p>47 straw] For 'strew', as in the A. V.</p>

<p>49 <i>1649</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, 'perceives' (an unconscious echo of 'leaves' in l. 48).</p>

reclassifications of the age of prose and sense. And this is one reason why I follow
the order of <i>1653</i> rather than that of <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>2 'Cud' is spelt in <i>1647</i> here and elsewhere in Cleveland 'cood'.</p>

<p>3 In some copies 'i<i>mi</i>tation', of course wrongly.</p>

<p>4 taste] cast <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>5 Cleveland gibed at Sternhold and Hopkins in prose (<i>The Character of a London
Diurnall</i>) as well as verse. <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i> misprint 'rhythm'.</p>

<p>11 The text, from <i>1677</i>, is a clear improvement at first sight on the earlier '<i>This</i> is
<i>a</i> feast': though I would not be too sure that Cleveland did not write it thus.</p>

<p>16 <i>1677</i> '<i>the</i> heavenly'.</p>

<p>17 <i>1677</i> 'he made'.</p>

<p>18 Meaning, apparently, that, as was the custom, the table between these sham
feast-days was moved off its trestles and cleared away; but the feast was a 'standing'
one, kept to reappear.</p>

<p>20 in th'] i' th' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>.</p>

<p>26 is] it <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>.</p>

<p>31 <i>1677</i> '<i>the</i> roast'.</p>

Act V.</p>

<p>39 Morglay] The sword of Bevis.</p>

<p>43 'Tis] It's <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>44 'him' <i>1647</i>: 'them' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>46 These lines appear with some variants and are not clear in any text: 'which he
had cluck'd under his wing' <i>1677</i>, for the earlier 'when he hath clock't under her wing'
<i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>. Professor Case suggests 'cloakt' (i.e. 'hidden') for 'clock't'.</p>

<p>50 Mr. Berdan says, '<i>Englishmen supposed</i> that the Scotch did not eat pork'. But,
until quite recently, it was a fact; and even now there is much less eaten north than
south of the Tweed. As for Cleveland's day, James the First's aversion to it was well
known and had been celebrated by Ben Jonson. In <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'But not a mouth
is muzzled by the Jew'.</p>

<p>51-2 Not in earlier editions. Added in <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>54 <i>1677</i> 'margin of <i>his</i> dish'.</p>

<p>55 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. omit 'care' and read 'tells them'.</p>

<p>59 <i>1677</i> 'Thou that didst'.</p>

<p>60 'turned thine' <i>1677</i>, <i>1687</i>: 'turn'st thy' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. mull] Dialectic
for 'cow', especially as a call-name. It seems to be connected with the sense of
the word for 'lips', especially large loose ones.</p>

<p>13 Edward Pond died in 1629; but the almanac, published by him first in 1601,
lasted till 1709. Rivers was probably Peregrine Rivers, 'Student in Mathematics',
writer of one of the numerous almanacs of the period. There are in the Bodleian
copies of his almanacs for 1629, 1630, 1638, all printed at Cambridge. (Information
supplied to me from Oxford.)</p>

<p>22 Rather a good line.</p>

<p>27 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. 'mayst': <i>1647</i>, <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. 'must'.</p>

<p>35 <i>1647</i> 'Monster Shrieves', <i>1653</i> 'Monster-Sheriffs', which can hardly be right.</p>

<p>44 'eighty-eight] The Armada year, often taken as a standard of remoteness not too
remote. This, which is the later reading, of 1677 <i>sqq.</i>, seems better than '<i>Thou
takest in thy</i> Eighty Eight' (<i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>49-62 The italics of <i>1653</i>, though discarded in <i>1677</i>, seem worth keeping, because
of the solemn call of attention to the particulars of the 'Vow'; they extend in the <i>1653</i>
text to l. 60.  But <i>1647</i> and <i>1651</i>, prefix inverted commas to ll. 49-56, which seems
a more effective ending to the 'Vow'.</p>

<p><i>A Dialogue, &amp;c.</i> (<i>1647</i>.) This occurs also in the <i>Rump</i> (1662, reprinted London,
<span class="sc">n. d.</span>). A MS. copy is found in Rawlinson MS. Poet. 26 of the Bodleian, at fol. 94,
with the title '<i>A Dialogue between 2. Zelots concerning &amp;c. in the new Oath</i>.' 'The
Oath' is the famous one formulated in 1640 by Convocation. Fuller, who was proctor
for the diocese of Bristol (and who would have been fined heavily for his part,
'moderate' as he was, if the Puritan Ultras of the Commons could have had their way),
has left much about it. This oath, to be taken by all the clergy, imported approval of
the doctrine, discipline, and government of the Church, and disclaimed, twice
over, 'Popish' doctrine and the usurpations of the see of Rome. Unluckily the
government of the Church was defined as 'by archbishops, bishops, deans, and
archdeacons, <i>&amp;c.</i>', which last was, in the absence of any other handle, seized by
the Puritan party as possibly implying all sorts of horrors. Cleveland banters them
well enough, but hardly with the force and directness which he was to show later.
The Royalists were then under the fatal error of underrating the strength of their
opponents, and the gullibility of the people of England.</p>

<p>2 'vicar', <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, <i>MS.</i>: 'vicarage' <i>1677</i>. 'children' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: I have
been waiting a long time to know what 'children's threes' means. It occurs elsewhere,
but to my thinking as an obvious reminiscence of Cleveland.</p>

'Quirpo', with 'cuerpo' written above it.</p>

<p>12 <i>1677</i> extends '&amp;c.' to 'et caetera'. This is a mistake, as the actual ampersand
occurred in the oath and gave some slight assistance to the cavillers. Cleveland's
expressions&mdash;'tail tied on a knot' (l. 14), 'curled lock' (l. 26), 'numerous folds'
(l. 32)&mdash;lose their point without the ampersand. <i>1677</i> also has '<i>may</i> conster', which
though possible enough, seems to me neither necessary nor even much of an improvement.</p>

<p>17 <i>1677</i>, less euphoniously, 'Whil<i>st</i>'.</p>

<p>22 A reading of the <i>Rump</i> version, 'Than all the Idolaters of the letter', though
almost certainly a mere mistaken correction, has some interest.</p>

<p>23 fell] sett <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>24 Goliah] This form occurs in all the texts.</p>

<p>25 In this and other lines that follow much of the quaintness is lost by 'extending'
the '&amp;c.' of the older editions.</p>

<p>28 were] are <i>1677</i>, <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>32 All editions, I think, before <i>1677</i> (which substitutes 'false') have 'half'. 'False'
is very feeble; 'half' refers picturesquely to the delineation of the Serpent tempting
Eve with a human head, being coiled below like the curves of the <i>&amp;c.</i> 'False' <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>33 <i>1677</i>, <i>MS.</i> 'Accurst Et Caetera! now, now I scent'.</p>

<p>34 I do not know whether these very Livyish oysters have been traced. <i>1677</i>
and <i>MS.</i> omit 'lately' and read 'prodigious bloody oysters'.</p>

<p>35 John Booker (1603-1677), Manchester man, haberdasher, writing-master, and
astrologer, gained a great deal of credit by interpreting an eclipse after the usual
fashion as portending disaster to kings and princes, the great Gustavus Adolphus and
the unfortunate Frederick, 'Winter'-King of Bohemia, being complaisant enough to
die in accordance.</p>

<p>36 This sign] <i>1677</i>, <i>MS.</i> 'This <i>fiend</i>'&mdash;more energetically.</p>

<p>37 ''Tis the dark vault where the' <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>40 The sting of 'the <i>Father Garnets</i> that <i>stand by</i> it' lies in
the words immediately preceding the obnoxious '&amp;c.'&mdash;'archbishops, bishops,
&amp;c.'&mdash;whom the Puritan divine stigmatizes as Jesuits and traitors to Church and State.
As has been stated, the oath distinctly, in set terms and twice over, abjured Rome
and all things Roman; but the Puritans of those days, like their descendants, paid
no attention to trifles of this kind. For 'stand' <i>MS.</i> reads 'stood'.</p>

<p>43 Yet] Nay <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>44 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i> 'abominous'; <i>1653</i> 'abhominous'. The 'h' must be kept in 'ab<i>h</i>ominous',
though not unusual for 'ab<i>om</i>-', because it helps to explain, and perhaps to
justify, <i>1677</i> and <i>MS.</i> in reading 'ab<i>d</i>ominous'. This, though something suggestive
of a famous Oxford story, derives some colour from 'untruss' and may be right,
especially as I do not know another example of 'abominous' for 'abominable'.</p>

<p>47 Og] <i>v. sup.</i>, <a href="#page31">p. 31</a>. <i>MS.</i> has marginal note 'Roan'.</p>

<p>48 'Skew-bald' is not = 'piebald', though most horses commonly called piebald are
skewbalds. 'Pie[magpie]bald' is <i>black</i> and white; skewbald <i>brown</i> (or some other
colour not black) and white. The Church-courts were much more unpopular, in these as
in mediaeval times, than the Church, and High Commissioners and commissaries
and apparitors were alleged to lurk under the guileful and dreadful '&amp;c.'</p>

<p>49 'babes' <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>52 Blount's <i>Glossographia</i> (1656), a useful book, shows the ignorance of Northern
English then prevailing by supposing 'we<i>a</i>-bit' (the form found in Cleveland originally)
to be '<i>way</i>-bit'. It is, of course, 'little bit', the Scotch 'mile and a bittock'.</p>

<p>53 Here] Then <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>. God's diggers] = nails or fingers. Commoner in
the corruption 'Ods niggers'.</p>

<p>54 'in words at large' <i>1647</i> ('at length', one issue of <i>1647</i>): 'at words in large'
<i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>: 'in words at length, and not in figures' <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>58 Edd. 'Cat<i>a</i>line', as usual, but <i>1677</i> 'Catiline'. 'He swears he'll be the Synod's'
<i>MS.</i></p>

<p>59 'Thus they drink on, not offering to depart' <i>MS.</i></p>

<p>60 <i>1677</i> omits 'quite'&mdash;no doubt for the old syllabic reason. <i>MS.</i> substitutes 'fully'.</p>

<p>62 Perhaps nowhere is the comic surprise of the symbol more wanted than here,
and more of a loss when that symbol is extended.</p>

<p><i>Smectymnuus, &amp;c.</i> (<i>1647</i>.) Whether this lively skit on the five 'reverend men whose
friend' Milton was (as far as he could be proud of being anything but himself) proud of
being was in Milton's own mind when he wrote his <i>Apology</i> for the acrostically named
treatise, one cannot say. It is a lively 'mime' enough, and he seems to throw
back that word with some special meaning. Cleveland's poem may have appeared
in the summer of 1641. Naturally, it is in the <i>Rump</i> poems.</p>

<p>3 All editions 'skilt'. It apparently must be as in text: 'skill't' for 'skill'st' = 'dost
thou [or 'does it'] signify?'</p>

<p>4 <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. 'Ape', but 'Ap' in the Welsh sense (Welsh having just been
mentioned) does well enough. It would go, not too roughly for Cleveland's syntax,
with 'conjurer'. Let some wizard, descended from all these, <i>and therefore knowing
all tongues</i>, translate.</p>

<p>6 This is rather interesting. Does it refer to Wessex or Devonshire dialect of
the day, or to old West Saxon? Junius did not edit Cædmon till fourteen years later,
but there was study of Anglo-Saxon from Parker's time at Cambridge.</p>

<p>7 the brotherhood] 'Brother' and 'sister' being constant sneers at the Puritan.</p>
<p>play their prizes] = 'fight'.</p>

<p>10 Perhaps another sneer at the 'train-bands' of the City.</p>

<p>15 'distinctly' <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>16 '<i>in</i> a' <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>18 I suppose <i>à la mode</i>, which is in <i>1677</i>, is right; but the '<i>all</i>-a-mode' of <i>1647</i>,
<i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> is tempting.</p>

<p>20 'murnival' or 'mournival'. Four aces, kings, &amp;c., especially at gleek.</p>

<p>22 <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. 'Or like <i>the College</i>'.</p>

<p>24 'h<i>a</i>llow' <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>25 I knew not this monster, and suspected that he would not be a delicate monster
to know. But Mr. Thorn-Drury has found him in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1777,
p. 482. Lazarus Collondo, a Genoese, had a small brother growing out of his side,
with one leg, two arms, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>29 'Smec' will now be an even greater attraction at the Sturbridge fair at
Cambridge. All fairs rejoiced in monsters.</p>

<p>36 '<i>The</i> change', as in <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> and its group, including the <i>Rump</i> version,
is not so good as 'her', which <i>1677</i> reads.</p>

<p>38 i.e. 'to go on to any <i>other</i> body'.</p>

<p>40 'Purlieu' seems to be used in the sense of 'precinct' or 'province'.</p>

<p>41-2 These lines are in all the seventeenth-century editions I have seen, but not in
Mr. Berdan's. The Scots pound was of course only twenty English pence, and so the
mark (two thirds) 'shrank' accordingly.</p>

<p>49 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1677</i> insert 'a' before 'sheet'. The metaphor is probably as old as
hunting. 'Spend', as Professor Case reminds me, has had already in <i>The Miser</i>, l. 67,
the sense of 'give tongue'. 'Scanned their feet' for 'kept pace' is good enough;
but why the five should leap a truss, and why this should be litigious, I again frankly
confess myself to have been ignorant. Mr. Simpson, however, quotes R. Fletcher in
<i>Ex Otio Negotium</i>, 1656, p. 202, 'The model of the new Religion':</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>How many Queere-religions? clear your throat,</p>
<p>May a man have a penyworth? four a groat?</p>
<p>Or do the <i>Iuncto</i> leap at truss a fayle?</p>
<p>Three tenents clap while five hang on the tayle?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cleveland seems to have tried in this piece to equal the mystery of the title of 'Smec'
by his own matter, and to have succeeded very fairly.</p>

<p>54 <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. '<i>shall</i> be'. 'at th'' <i>1647</i>, <i>1677</i>: 'at the' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>55 cooped] cooked <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>.</p>

<p>56 <i>1677</i>, &amp;c. '<i>the</i> name'.</p>

<p>57 An absurd, but doubtless in the circumstances dangerous, document of the kind
was actually disseminated, in which the prentices bold engaged 'to defend his Sacred
Majesty against Popish innovations such as archbishops and bishops appear to be'.</p>

<p>63 carrot-bunch] Cant for 'fingers'.</p>

<p>70 'pay' <i>1653</i>, <i>1677</i>: 'pays' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>. <i>1677</i> '<i>and</i> use'.</p>

<p>75 'Banns' <i>1677</i>: 'Banes' in earlier texts. <i>1653</i> 'time'.</p>

<p>78 The Convocation which had been guilty of '&amp;c.', and the Commons who mostly
sympathized with 'Smec'.</p>

<p>79 foxes' tails] As at Samson's marriage (Judges xv. 4-7.)</p>

<p>80 Mosel[e]y, Milton's printer; and Sancta Clara, the Jesuit?</p>

<p>82 <i>1677</i> 'plurality'.</p>

<p>83 'Vestry, but' <i>1677</i>: 'Vestery' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>84 <i>1677</i> 'Bets'.</p>

<p>90 The heraldic terms are pretty plain, but <i>1677</i> reads 'is spade' i.e. 'spayed', as
in <i>The Hecatomb to his Mistress</i>, l. 2.</p>

<p>94 Rhyme here really badly managed.</p>

<p>95 <i>1677</i> 'another's'.</p>

<p>97 The fear and dislike of Henrietta Maria (whom Mr. Berdan supposes to be meant)
among the disaffected is only too certain: and the fate of Prynne's ears for his scandal
of her is notorious. But why <i>at this time</i> she should be called a Queen Mother (it
was her proper title afterwards, and she was one of the very few to whom it was
actually given), and what the last line means, I know not. Nor does Professor Firth,
unless Marie de Médicis (who <i>was</i> Queen Mother in France and had visited England)
had, as he suggests, a share in some leather patent, and is meant here. Smec's ears
are 'vellum' in <i>Rupertismus</i>, 169 (<i>v. inf.</i>, <a href="#page67">p. 67</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Mixed Assembly</i> (<i>1647</i>.) This was the famous 'Westminster' Assembly which
met in July, 1643&mdash;a hodge-podge of half a score peers, a score of commoners, and
about four times as many divines as laymen. Tanner MS. 465, of the Bodleian, has
a poor copy of this poem; but some transpositions and omissions suggest that it
preserves an earlier draft. Lines 63-6 follow 52; 71-8, 81-2, are omitted.</p>

<p>19 In a fable a Royston crow (the town being on the way to Cambridge had probably
a bad reputation for fleecing the guileless undergraduate) advised an innocent of
his kind to drop a shellfish from a height on rocks where the Royston bird was waiting
and secured the meat.</p>

<p>28 <i>1677</i> changes 'But' to 'That'.</p>

<p>29 <i>1677</i> inserts '<i>go</i>' before 'stroke'. But Cleveland probably scanned 'I-sa-ac'.
The reference is to Isaac Pennington: cf. <i>The Rebel Scot</i>, l. 79.</p>

<p>30 The phrase is of course Homeric (<i>sc.</i> <ins title="Greek: domous">&delta;&#8057;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</ins>) and with its companion combines
the idea of an ecclesiastical condemnation ('delivering over to Satan') and a civil
execution, a writ of <i>elegit</i>.</p>

<p>32 faun] All old editions, I think, and Mr. Berdan, 'fa<i>w</i>n'. But the <i>animal</i>
(always now indicated by that spelling) is not of a 'twisted nature', the half-god is.</p>

<p>40 One of those that taught Dryden something.</p>

Shakespeare. A copy of <i>1677</i> in my possession has a manuscript list of references on

<p>49 'Stript', <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, is evidently 'striped', and is printed 'strip'd' in <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>53 Philip Herbert, fourth Earl of Pembroke, though a patron of literature and the
arts, was a man of bad character and a virulent Roundhead.</p>

<p>60 Algernon Percy, tenth Earl of Northumberland&mdash;who repented too late of his
rebellion and tried to prevent the consequences&mdash;seems to have joined the Roundheads
out of pique (his pride was notorious) at neglect of his suggestions and interference
with his powers as Lord High Admiral). By putting the fleet into the hands of the
Parliament he did the King perhaps more hurt than any other single person at the
beginning of the war. 'Algernoon' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>: later texts spoil the point of the next
line by using the conventional form.</p>

<p>68 Fielding] Basil, the degenerate son of the first Earl of Denbigh. He actually
served in the Parliamentary Army, but like Northumberland, who did not go that
length, repented too late.</p>

<p>Doxie Marshall] The Stephen Marshall of <i>Smectymnuus</i> and the 'Geneva Bull' of
<i>The Rebel Scot</i>, l. 21; exactly why 'Doxie' I do not know. Possibly 'prostitute' from
his eager Presbyterianism. It is odd that Anne and Rebecca Marshall, two famous
actresses of the Restoration to whom the term might be applied with some direct
justification, used to be counted his daughters, though this is now denied.</p>

<p>69 Twisse] William (1578-1646), the Prolocutor of the Assembly.</p>

<p>71 Saye and Sele] William Fiennes, first Viscount (1582-1662). Of very bad reputation
as a slippery customer.</p>

<p>72 rumpled] Mr. Berdan 'rumbled', on what authority and with what meaning I do not
know. 'Rumpled', which is in <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, and <i>1677</i>, no doubt refers to the untidy
bands, &amp;c. of a slovenly priest. Herbert Palmer (1604-1647) was a man of good
family but a bitter Puritan. He was first Fellow and then President of Queens' College,
Cambridge, where Cleveland doubtless knew him. The odd description reads like
that of a sort of deformed dwarf.</p>

<p>75 Kimbolton] Edward, Lord (1602-1671), just about to become the well-known
Earl of Manchester of the Rebellion. Like Northumberland and Denbigh, he repented,
but only after he had been not too politely shelved for Fairfax and Cromwell.</p>

<p>76 Cleveland would have been delighted had he known the fate of Cornelius Burges
(1589?-1665), of whom he evidently had a pretty bad idea. Burges, a Wadham and
Lincoln man, was one of the leaders of the Puritans among the London clergy, and
a great favourite with the House of Commons in the Long Parliament. He wanted to
suppress cathedrals; and, being a practical man and preacher at Wells during the
Commonwealth, did his best by buying the deanery and part of the estates. Wherefore
he was promptly and properly ruined by the Restoration, and died in well-deserved
poverty. He was vice-president of the Westminster Assembly.</p>

<p>79 Oliver Bowles, a Puritan divine. <i>1653</i> omits the comma after 'sadness' found in
<i>1651</i>,&mdash;a neat punctuation, meaning 'in good sadness, he cannot dance'. Phrases like
'in good truth', 'in good sadnesse' were the utmost licence of speech which the
Puritans permitted themselves.</p>

<p>81 Philip, fourth Lord Wharton (1613-1696) took the anti-Royalist side very early,
but cut a very poor figure at Edgehill and abandoned active service. He did not
figure under the Commonwealth, but was a zealous Whig after the Restoration, and
a prominent Williamite in the last years of his long life. Who 'Lidy' (<i>1653</i>) or
'Lidie' (<i>1677</i>) was seems unknown. Professor Firth suggests a misprint for 'Sidie,'
i.e. Sidrach Simpson (1600?-1655), a busy London Puritan and member of the Assembly.
Another ingenious suggestion made to me is that 'mumping Lid[d]y' may be one of the
queer dance-names of the period, or actually a woman, Wharton being no enemy to
the sex. But I do not know that there was such a dance, and as all the other pairs are
males, being members of the Assembly, it would be odd if there were an exception
here. For 'Here' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i> read 'Her'.</p>

<p>88 The exceptional position of Selden is well hit off here. His character and his
earning were just able to neutralize, though not to overcome, the curse of Laodicea.</p>

<p>95 'Brooke' is Robert Brooke, second Lord Brooke, cousin and successor of Fulke
Greville&mdash;the 'fanatic Brooke' who had his 'guerdon meet' by being shot in his
attack on Lichfield Cathedral. <i>Mercurius Anti-Britannicus</i>, 1645, p. 23, has:

<p><i>The Kings Disguise</i>.] That assumed on the fatal journey from Oxford to the camp
of the Scots. (First printed as a quarto pamphlet of four leaves; Thomason bought his

first rather than of the second half of the century. It is therefore probably right.</p>

<p>19 The <i>1677</i> 'Vindicators' had forgotten 'budge' in the sense of 'fur' (perhaps they
were too loyal to read Milton) and made it 'b<i>a</i>dge'.</p>

<p>20 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'Synod', with no hyphen but perhaps meant for a compound. The genitive
is perhaps better. The comma at 'sable', which Mr. Berdan omits, is important.</p>

<p>21-2 The error of those who say that such a rhyme points to the pronunciation of
the <i>l</i> in words like 'could' is sufficiently shown by the fact that 'coud' is frequent.
It is, of course, a mere eye-rhyme, like many of Spenser's earlier. 'No bodily' <i>1647</i>

time designates 'the College <i>of Physicians</i>'. But, as Mr. Berdan well observes, 'the
case was unfortunately too common to admit of identification'. Cleveland's restless
wit was not idle in calling 'Manchester's elves'&mdash;the Parliamentary troops&mdash;'changelings'.
The soldier ought to be a King's man: and indeed pretended to be.</p>

<p>32 <i>1647</i> (pamphlet) 'reformed'.</p>

<p>40 This and l. 47 are examples of the Drydenian line before Dryden, so frequent in
Cleveland.</p>

<p>46 = 'The unborn child of a cloud'.</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Some fight might be made for 'Metal', but 'Nor' is indefensible. I am half inclined
to transfer it above to l. 52 and take 'No' thence. The text, which is <i>1677</i>, is I suppose
a correction. Both <i>1647</i> texts mark 'slough' with an asterisk, and have a marginal
note 'A damp in coal-pits usual'.</p>

<p>57 I cannot understand what Mr. Berdan&mdash;who prints 'Fawkes'&mdash;means by saying
it is not authorized by any edition, whereas his own apparatus gives 'Faux' in every
one. It is a mere question of spelling. 'Three-piled darkness' equally surrounds to me
his further remark that he 'adopted it as the only reading approximating sense;
<i>treason in grain</i>'. The metaphor of the dark lantern cloaked is surely clear enough;
and this 'in grain' is one of the innumerable passages showing the rashness of
invariably interpreting 'in grain' as = 'with the grain of the cochineal insect'.
Beyond all doubt it has the simple sense of <i>penitus</i>, 'inward'.</p>

general, reference of 'Hue and Cry'. It seems that <i>Mercurius Britannicus</i> did issue a
'Hue and Cry' after the King, for which the editor, Captain Audley, was put in the
Gate-house till he apologized.</p>

<p>75 <i>1651</i> 'wreath', corrupted into 'wrath' in <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Rebel Scot</i>.] This famous piece is said to be the only one of Cleveland's poems
which is in every edition. In <i>1677</i> it is accompanied by a Latin version (of very little
merit, and probably if not certainly by 'another hand') which I do not give. A poor
copy is in Tanner MS. 465 of the Bodleian, at fol. 92, with the title 'A curse on the
Scots'. The piece is hot enough, and no wonder; but it would no doubt have been
hotter if it had been written later, when Cleveland was actually gagged by Leven's
dismissal of him. It is not unnoteworthy that the library of the University of Edinburgh
contains not a single one of the numerous seventeenth-century editions of Cleveland.
Years afterwards, when a Douglas had chequered the disgrace of 'the Dutch in the
Medway' by a brave death, Marvell, who probably knew our poet, composed for
'Cleveland's Ghost' a half palinode, half continuation, entitled 'The <i>Loyal</i> Scot'.</p>

<p>10 It would seem that Pym had not yet gone to his account, as he died on December 6,
1643, after getting Parliament to accept the Covenant and the Scots to invade
England.</p>

<p>12 The early texts have Drayton's name correctly: <i>1677</i> makes it 'Pigwidgin'.</p>

painting Judas's hair red.</p>

<p>21 Stephen Marshall, the 'Smec.' man and a mighty cushion-thumper (who denounced
the 'Curse of Meroz' on all who came not to destroy those in any degree opposed to
the Parliament), actually preached Pym's funeral sermon.</p>

<p>22 'Damnati-on'. But <i>MS.</i> reads 'a whole pulpit full'.</p>

<p>28 <i>1653</i> has the obvious blunder of 'feet' repeated for 'teeth'. The first 'feet'
is itself less obvious, but I suppose the strong claw and grip of the badger's are meant.
Some, however, refer it to the supposed lop-sidedness or inequality of badgers' feet,
answering to the &#9169;&mdash; of the iamb. I never knew but one badger, who lived in
St. Clement's, Oxford, and belonged (surreptitiously) to Merton College. I did not
notice his feet.</p>

<p>32 The more usual reproach was the other way&mdash;that 'the Scot would not fight <i>till</i>
he saw his own blood'.</p>

<p>38 <i>1677</i>, less well, '<i>that</i> Scot'.</p>

<p>44 A difficulty has been made about 'collegiate', but there is surely none. The

the Tower as a prison and a menagerie should of course be remembered.</p>

served after the downfall in France and Spain, and died, it is not accurately known
when or where, but about 1652.</p>

<i>1647</i> 'Hemerods'.</p>

<p>84 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> and its group, oddly, 'posture'.</p>

<p>95 'left' <i>1653</i>, &amp;c., <i>1677</i>: 'gave' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>. The <i>MS.</i> reads 'But they may justly
quit their leaner soil. 'Tis to lard ...'</p>

<p>101 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'goodly', but here, I think, the old is not the better.</p>

<p>108 <i>1647</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. 'pound', wrongly. Twenty Scots pence = not quite two-pence
English. Therefore 'well so'.</p>

<p>118 <i>1641</i>, <i>1651</i>, and <i>1653</i> 'the Spaniards', but 'some' (<i>1677</i>) is more pointed.</p>

<p><i>The Scots' Apostasy</i> was first printed as a broadside in <i>1646</i>, and assigned at the
time to Cleveland by Thomas Old. It was included in <i>1651</i>, but not admitted by the
'Vindicators' in <i>1677</i>. But it is in all the central group of editions except <i>Cleaveland
Revived</i>, where absence is usually a strong proof of genuineness; and it is extremely
like him. Mr. Berdan has admitted it, and so do I. Professor Case has noted
a catalogue entry of <i>The Scot's Constancy, an answer to J. C's.</i> [<i>al.</i> Or an Answer to
Cleveland's] <i>Scots' Apostasy</i> (G. R. Bastick) [<i>al.</i> Robin Bostock], London April 1647.
The 'J. C's' is of course pertinent.</p>

<p>2 John Campbell (1598-1633), from 1620 Baron Loudoun in his wife's right, was,
after taking a violent part on the Covenant side in the earlier Scotch-English war,
instrumental in concluding peace; and was made in 1641 Chancellor of Scotland
and Earl of Loudoun.</p>

<p>9 'imposture' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>20 The celebrated and grisly collection of Scottish monarchs in Holyrood was
not yet in existence; for its imaginative creator only painted it in 1684, and there are
106, not sixty. But the remoteness of Scottish pedigrees was popularly known: and if
it be not true that all Scottish kings were murdered, not a few had been.</p>

<p>24 'Assassination' is valued at six syllables.</p>

<p>28 'to' <i>1651</i>, &amp;c.: 'into' <i>1646</i>.</p>

<p>34 'count you' <i>1646</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c.: 'be your' <i>1687</i>. This prayer, at any rate,
was heard pretty soon.</p>

<p><i>Rupertismus</i>] '<i>To P. Rupert</i>' in the <i>1647</i> texts (Bodley and Case copies). The odd
title <i>Rupertismus</i> was first given in <i>1651</i>. This poem expresses the earlier and more
sanguine Cavalier temper, when things on the whole went well. Rupert's admirable
quality as an officer naturally made him a sort of Cavalier cynosure and (with his being
half a foreigner) a bugbear to the Roundheads; while neither party had yet found out
his fatal defects as a general. Hence 'Rupertismus' not ill described the humour of both
sides. The dog who figures so largely was a real dog (said of course to be a familiar
spirit), and Professor Firth tells me that he has a pamphlet (1642) entitled <i>Observations
upon P. R.'s white dog called Boy, carefully taken by T. B.</i>, with a picture of the animal.
It was replied to by <i>The Parliament's Unspotted Bitch</i> next year.</p>

Puritans till Swift's thrice rectified vitriol almost destroyed the abuse itself.</p>

<p>8 malignant] in the technical Roundhead sense.</p>

<p>9 The gibe at Huntingdon, clear enough from the passage, is one of many old local
insults. I can remember when it was a little unsafe, in one of the Channel islands, to
speak of a donkey. This particular jest recurs in Pepys (May 22, 1677), who was in a
way a Huntingdon man.</p>

<p>14 '<i>The</i> Prince' was a title which Rupert monopolized early and kept till his death.</p>

<p>15 'these' <i>1677</i>: 'the' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, <i>1687</i>.</p>

<p>79 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'Cit'z' (not quite bad for '<i>citiz</i>ens) and 'flea of the place'. 'Flea'
for 'flay' is not uncommon: the rest is absurd. 'Isaac' was Isaac Pennington, father
of that Judith whose obliging disposition Mr. Pepys has commemorated.</p>

<p>80 'Antl<i>ets</i>', which occurs in all, is not impossible for 'antl<i>ers</i>' (the everlastingly
ridiculed citizen 'horns'). But <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> forgot the Golden Calf altogether in
their endeavour to provide a rhyme for their own misprint (l. 79) by reading 'Stace'.</p>

<p>83 'Gossip's' (<i>1651</i>, <i>1677</i>) is not wanted and hisses unnecessarily.</p>

<p>86 'self-wants' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, <i>1687</i>. <i>1677</i>, most improbably, 'committee'. The
whole passage refers to the subscriptions of plate and money in lieu of personal service
which Pennington, as Lord Mayor, promised 'on the Public Faith'. Rupert's self outweighs
all this vicarious performance.</p>

<p>114 The text is <i>1677</i>, which, however, reads (with the usual want of strait-lacedness)
'straight'. <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, have 'Yet' for 'And', which is corrected in some of their own
group, and 'sweats'.</p>

<p>117 some] Like Mr. Badman a little later.</p>

<p>120 gig] = 'spin like a top'. Dryden uses the word in the same sense and almost in
the same phrase in the Prologue to <i>Amphitryon</i>, l. 21: <i>v. sup.</i>,<a href="#footnotetagcv2"> p. 17</a>.</p>

<p>121 giblets] Apparently in the sense of 'offal', 'refuse'.</p>

<p>123 Lunsford] Sir Thomas, 1610?-1653. The absurd legends about this Cavalier's
'child-eating' are referred to in, originally, <i>Hudibras</i> and in Lacy's <i>Old Troop</i>, and at
second-hand (probably from the text also, though it is not quoted) in the notes to
Scott's <i>Woodstock</i>. <i>1651</i> and <i>1653</i> have 'which' for second 'that'.</p>

<p>124 steaks] All old editions 'stakes'&mdash;a very common spelling, which Mr. Berdan
keeps. As he modernizes the rest, his readers may be under the impression that the
ogre impaled the infants before devouring them, which was not, I think, alleged by the
most savoury professor on the Roundhead side.</p>

<p>127 souse] = 'pickle'. 'they have these' <i>1677</i>: 'they've several' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>: 'they
have several' <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>130 Bishop's] <i>1677</i>, <i>1687</i> editions have the apostrophe. Laud is probably referred
to in 'Bishop's'. The force of all this, and its application to other times, are admirable.</p>

<p>133 The Countess&mdash;pretty clearly Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle (1599-1660)&mdash;beauty,
wit, harlot, and traitress (though, too late, she repented). Amsterdam] The
religious indifference of the Dutch being a common reproach. <i>1677</i> and its followers
read 'with' for 'will', which would alter the sense completely.</p>

<p>134 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> have 'religious' in the well-known noun sense, and it is
possibly better.</p>

<p>144 Sir Arthur Haselrig (died 1661)&mdash;a very busy person throughout the troubles,
but not considered as exactly a prime mover.</p>

<p>148 <i>1677</i> '<i>the</i> cur'.</p>

<p>149 'rabble' is <i>1677</i> and seems good, though the earlier 'rebel' might do.</p>

<p>152 a fault] <i>1677</i> default&mdash;not so technical.</p>

<p>153 Serjeants John Glyn[ne] (1607-66) and John Maynard (1602-90) were well-known
legal bandogs on the Roundhead side in the earlier stages; but both trimmed
cleverly during the later, and sold themselves promptly to the Crown at the Restoration.
Glynne died soon. Maynard lived to prosecute the victims of the Popish Plot, and
to turn his coat once more, at nearly ninety, for William of Orange.</p>

<p>155 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'l<i>a</i>bels': <i>1677</i> 'Thus libels but amount to him we see T' enjoy'.</p>

<p>158 <i>1677</i> 'St. Peter', which looks plausible, though I am not sure that it is better than
the genitive. <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> have 'yet' for 'and' as in other cases.</p>

<p>167 the accumulative king] Pym? who was nicknamed 'king' Pym, and if not
exactly 'accumulative' (for his debts were paid by Parliament) must have been expensive
and was probably rapacious. Others think it means 'the Committee',
'accumulative' being = 'cumulative' (or rather 'plural'). They quote, not without
force, our poet's prose <i>Character of a Country Committee man</i>, 'a Committee man
is a name of multitude', the phrase 'accumulative treason' occurring in the context.</p>

<p>175 <i>1677</i> transfers 'the' to before 'Nurse'&mdash;a great loss, the unarticled and familiar
'Nurse' being far better&mdash;and reads 'Sibils charm'.</p>

<p>176 'and' <i>1653</i>, 1677: 'nay and' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1687.</i></p>

<p>177 <i>1677</i> 'Clown salutes'.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Epitaph, &amp;c.</i> In the Bodleian copy of <i>1647</i> and in Professor Case's (3rd issue)
and in all others except <i>Cleaveland Revived</i> (<i>1659</i>) and <i>1677</i>; but in some of the
earliest classed with the work of 'Uncertain Authors'. Winstanley (no very strong
authority, it is true) calls it Cleveland's and 'excellent'. It is perhaps too much to say
with Mr. Berdan, that it is 'unlike his manner'. There is certainly in it a manner
which he does not often display, but the pity and the terror of that great tragedy
might account for part of this, and the difficulty (for any Royalist) of speaking freely of
it for more. It is rather fine, I think.</p>

<p>4 The pitiful truth could hardly be better put.</p>

<p>6 Obscure, but not un-Clevelandish.</p>

<p>7-8 Punctuation altered to get what seems the necessary sense. A comma which
<i>1653</i> has at 'grief' (not to mention a full stop in the <i>1647</i> texts) obscures this, and a
comma at 'wanted', which Mr. Berdan puts, does so even more. The phrase is once
more fatally just and true. He enjoyed all his master's affection and received all his
grief, but 'wanted' his support and relief. Professor Case, however, would cling to
the stop, at least the comma, at 'grief'.</p>

<p>12 or] Other editions 'and'. For 'Riddles' cf. <i>The King's Disguise</i>, ll. 89-90.</p>

<p>13-14 For the third time 'he says it', and there is no more to say.&mdash;In <i>1653</i> there
follows a Latin Epitaph on Strafford which has nothing to do with this. It is in some
phrases enigmatic enough to be Cleveland's, but it is not certainly his, and as it is
neither English nor verse we need hardly give it.</p>

<p><i>An Elegy, &amp;c.</i> (<i>1647</i>.) If the Strafford epitaph seemed too serious, as well as too concentrated
and passionate, for Cleveland, this on Strafford's fellow worker and fellow
victim may seem almost a caricature of our author's more wayward and more fantastic
manner. Yet there are fine lines in it, and perhaps nowhere else do we see the
Dryden fashion of verse (though not of thought) more clearly foreshadowed. It
appears to come under 'Uncertain Authors' in some <i>1647</i> texts, but <i>1677</i> gives it.
Title in <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'On the Archbishop of Canterbury' only.</p>

<p>4 <i>1677</i> '<i>by</i> art'.</p>

<p>6 <i>1677</i> '<i>in</i> soft'.</p>

<p>8 Thomas Bushel[l] or Bushnell (1594-1674) was a page of Bacon's and afterwards
a great 'projector' in mining and mechanical matters generally. He dabbled largely
in fancy fountains and waterworks&mdash;a queer taste of the seventeenth century in which
even the sober Evelyn records his own participation.</p>

<p>9-10 Cf. the opening of the elegy on King, 'I like not tears in tune'.</p>

<p>11 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. '<i>when</i> he mourns', which is hardly so good.</p>

<p>18 Seth's pillars] A tradition, preserved in Josephus, that the race of Seth engraved
antediluvian wisdom on two pillars, one of brick, the other of stone, the latter of which
outlasted the Deluge.</p>

<p>20 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, &amp;c. '<i>From</i> much'.</p>

<p>34 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i> misprint '<i>Agena</i>-like.</p>

<p>35 <i>1653</i> misprints 'blackish'.</p>

<p>38 <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i> 'noble'.</p>

<p>44 <i>1677</i>, omitting the comma at 'act', makes something like nonsense; 'by prophecy'
goes, I think, with 'adjudged to die'.</p>

<p>50 One would expect 'Chesterfield', for Grantham nowadays does not look very
crooked&mdash;at least from the railway. But Fuller in the <i>Worthies</i> quotes this as a
proverb. Some take it as referring to the height and slenderness of the steeple and
an optical illusion. They might quote 'The high masts <i>flickered</i> as they lay afloat'.
But few travellers had the excuse of Iphigenia.</p>

<p><i>On I. W. A. B. of York</i>. (<i>1647</i>.) This vigorous onslaught on the trimmer John Williams,
Archbishop of York, who began public life as a tool of Buckingham's and ended it as
a kind of tolerated half-deserter to the Parliament, was turned out by the 'Vindicators'
in <i>1677</i>. There may, however, have been reasons for this, other than certain spuriousness.
Williams, though driven to doubtful conduct by his enmity with Laud, never
called himself anything but a Royalist, was imprisoned as such, and is said to have
died of grief (perhaps of compunction) at the King's execution. Also both Lake and
Drake were Yorkshire men. The piece is vigorous, if not quite Clevelandish in the
presence of some enjambment, and the absence of extravagant conceit.</p>

<p>10 whatever] Perhaps we should read 'whatsoe'er'.</p>

<p>16 A parody of course on Prynne's <i>Histrio-mastix</i>.</p>

<p>21 'he' = Proteus. Williams went right over.</p>

<p>23 Williams was very popular with his fellow provincials. He took refuge in Wales
when the war broke out, and was made a sort of mediator by the Welsh after Naseby.</p>

<p>26 'Religion's' <i>1647</i>; 'Religious' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>.</p>

<p>27 <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>, 'I' th'': but here, as often, the apostrophation ruins the verse.</p>

<p>30 'hath' <i>1653</i>: 'has' <i>1647</i>, <i>1651</i>.</p>

<p>32 Williams had been chairman of the Committee 'to consider innovations' in 1641.
His private malice was to Laud.</p>

<p>46 I am not certain of the meaning. But Lincolnshire (at least Lindsey) was
strongly Royalist early in the war till Cromwell's successes at Grantham, Lea Moor,
and Winceby in 1643.</p>

<p><i>How the Commencement, &amp;c.</i>, belongs to the same group as the <i>Mark Antony</i>
poems and <i>Square-Cap</i>, and there is the same ambiguity between four anapaests and
five iambs. You would certainly take line 1 as it stands in <i>1677</i> with ''Tis' for 'It is',
and probably as it stands here, for a heroic if line 2 did not come to undeceive you.
And this line 2 is bad as either.</p>

<p>First printed in <i>1653</i>. MS. copies are found in Rawlinson MS. Poet. 147, pp. 48-9,
and Tanner MS. 465, fol. 83, of the Bodleian. Neither copy is good, but each helps
to restore the text (see ll. 18 and 38). The Tanner MS. also has on fol. 44 an indignant
poem 'Upon Mr. Cl. who made a Song against the DD<sup>rs</sup>', beginning</p>

<p>45 Cleveland lived to think better of Oxford&mdash;at least to take refuge and be warmly
welcomed there. There has probably been no time at which either University was
not convinced that the other, whatever its merits, could not see a joke.</p>

<p>48 <i>1665</i> (not a very good edition) and the <i>MSS.</i> read 'Mu<i>n</i>', which was of course
the usual short for Edmund. But 'Mu<i>m</i>' in the context is appropriate enough and
generally read.</p>

<p>The intense Cambridge flavour of this seems to require special comment by
a Cambridge man. For the duties of the 'Prevaricator' refer to Peacock's <i>Observations
on the Statutes of the University of Cambridge</i>, 1841 (information kindly furnished by
Mr. A. J. Bartholomew).</p>

<p><i>The Antiplatonic</i>. (<i>1653</i>.) This is a sort of half-way house between Cleveland's
burlesques and his serious or semi-serious poems like <i>Fuscara</i>. It is also nearer to
Suckling and the graceful-graceless school than most of his things. It is good.</p>

<p>2 The alteration of <i>1677</i> 'and ne'er fall to her' may be only an example of the
tendency to 'regularize' (in this case by the omission of an extra foot). But I confess
it seems to me better: for the slight irregularity of the construction replaces that of the
line to advantage.</p>

<p>10 I don't know whether the conceit of 'Pygmalion's <i>widow</i>' returning to marble
(or ivory) when her husband-lover's embraces ceased is original with Cleveland. If
it is, I make him my compliment. There is at any rate no hint of it in Ovid.</p>

<p>18 <i>1677</i> changed the good old '<i>for</i>' to 'thus'.</p>

<p>19 sectaries of] = 'heretics in'.</p>

<p>20 This is good: 'calcining flame' is good.</p>

<p>22 'dubs' is said to mean 'stabs', as it certainly means 'strikes'; but this seems to
have little or no appropriateness here and to ignore the quaint conceit of 'commence'
in its academic meaning. 'Women <i>take their degrees</i> by Cupid's dart: as the fact of
being hunted by a king <i>ennobles</i> a hart.' Cupid = the King of Love.</p>

<p>24 'parole' too has a very delectable double meaning. This poem is really full of
most excellent differences.</p>

<p>25-9 The lesson of the unregenerate Donne and the never-regenerate Carew.</p>

<p>32 gamesters] = 'fencers'. to seek at sharp] = 'not good at sword-play'.</p>

<p>33 'The sol-di-er'. By the way, did Butler borrow this 'iron' and 'environ'
rhyme from Cleveland?</p>

<p>43 The apostrophating mania made <i>1653</i> contract to 'let's' and spoil the verse.</p>

<p>44 Th'] here of course = 'they'.</p>

<h3>Fuscara, or the Bee Errant.</h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Nature's confectioner, the bee</p>
<p>(Whose suckets are moist alchemy,</p>
<p>The still of his refining mould</p>
<p>Minting the garden into gold),</p>
<p>Having rifled all the fields</p>
<p>Of what dainties Flora yields,</p>
<p>Ambitious now to take excise</p>
<p>Of a more fragrant paradise,</p>
<p>At my Fuscara's sleeve arrived</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Where all delicious sweets are hived.</p>
<p>The airy freebooter distrains</p>
<p>First on the violets of her veins,</p>
<p>Whose tincture, could it be more pure,</p>
<p>His ravenous kiss had made it bluer.</p>
<p>Here did he sit and essence quaff</p>
<p>Till her coy pulse had beat him off;</p>
<p>That pulse which he that feels may know</p>
<p>Whether the world 's long-lived or no.</p>
<p>The next he preys on is her palm,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>That alm'ner of transpiring balm;</p>
<p>So soft, 'tis air but once removed;</p>
<p>Tender as 'twere a jelly gloved.</p>
<p>Here, while his canting drone-pipe scanned</p>
<p>The mystic figures of her hand,</p>
<p>He tipples palmistry and dines</p>
<p>On all her fortune-telling lines.</p>
<p>He bathes in bliss and finds no odds</p>
<p>Betwixt her nectar and the gods',</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[page&nbsp;80]</span>
<p>He perches now upon her wrist,</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>A proper hawk for such a fist,</p>
<p>Making that flesh his bill of fare</p>
<p>Which hungry cannibals would spare;</p>
<p>Where lilies in a lovely brown</p>
<p>Inoculate carnation.</p>
<p>He <i>argent</i> skin with <i>or</i> so streamed</p>
<p>As if the milky way were creamed.</p>
<p>From hence he to the woodbine bends</p>
<p>That quivers at her fingers' ends,</p>
<p>That runs division on the tree</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Like a thick-branching pedigree.</p>
<p>So 'tis not her the bee devours,</p>
<p>It is a pretty maze of flowers;</p>
<p>It is the rose that bleeds, when he</p>
<p>Nibbles his nice phlebotomy.</p>
<p>About her finger he doth cling</p>
<p>I' th' fashion of a wedding-ring,</p>
<p>And bids his comrades of the swarm</p>
<p>Crawl as a bracelet 'bout her arm.</p>
<p>Thus when the hovering publican</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Had sucked the toll of all her span,</p>
<p>Tuning his draughts with drowsy hums</p>
<p>As Danes carouse by kettle-drums,</p>
<p>It was decreed, that posie gleaned,</p>
<p>The small familiar should be weaned.</p>
<p>At this the errant's courage quails;</p>
<p>Yet aided by his native sails</p>
<p>The bold Columbus still designs</p>
<p>To find her undiscovered mines.</p>
<p>To th' Indies of her arm he flies,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Fraught both with east and western prize;</p>
<p>Which when he had in vain essayed,</p>
<p>Armed like a dapper lancepresade</p>
<p>With Spanish pike, he broached a pore</p>
<p>And so both made and healed the sore:</p>
<p>For as in gummy trees there 's found</p>
<p>A salve to issue at the wound,</p>
<p>Of this her breach the like was true:</p>
<p>Hence trickled out a balsam, too.</p>
<p>But oh, what wasp was 't that could prove</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Ravaillac to my Queen of Love!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[page&nbsp;81]</span>
<p>The King of Bees now 's jealous grown</p>
<p>Lest her beams should melt his throne,</p>
<p>And finding that his tribute slacks,</p>
<p>His burgesses and state of wax</p>
<p>Turned to a hospital, the combs</p>
<p>Built rank-and-file like beadsmen's rooms,</p>
<p>And what they bleed but tart and sour</p>
<p>Matched with my Danae's golden shower,</p>
<p>Live-honey all,&mdash;the envious elf</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Stung her, 'cause sweeter than himself.</p>
<p class="i2">Sweetness and she are so allied</p>
<p>The bee committed parricide.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Fuscara</i>. (<i>1651</i>.) Cleveland's most famous poem of the amatory, as <i>The Rebel Scot</i> is
of the political, kind. In <i>1677</i> and since it has been set in the forefront of his <i>Poems</i>,
and Johnson draws specially on it for his famous diatribe against the metaphysicals in
the 'Life of Cowley'. It seems to me inferior both to <i>The Muses' Festival</i> and to <i>The
Antiplatonic</i>, and, as was said in the Introduction, it betrays, to me, something of an
intention to fool the lovers of a fashionable style to the top of their bent. But it has
extremely pretty things in it; and Mr. Addison, who denounced and scorned 'false
wit', never 'fair-sexed it' in half so poetical a manner.</p>

<p>2 'Suckets' or 'succades' should need interpretation to no reader of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>: and no one who has not read <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> deserves to be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>13 tincture] Said to be used here in an alchemical sense for 'gold'. But the plain
meaning is much better.</p>

<p>18 Although the sense is not quite the same as, it is much akin to, that of Browning's
question&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'Who knows but the world may end to night?'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>20 Cleveland of course uses the correct and not the modern and blundering sense of
'transpire'.</p>

<p>22 This 'jelly gloved' is <i>not</i> like 'mobled queen' or 'calcining flame'.</p>

<p>25-6 <i>1653</i> and its group have a queer misprint (carried out so as to rhyme, but hardly
possible as a true reading) of 'dives' and 'lives'. If they had had 'In' instead of
'On' it would have been on the (metaphysical) cards, especially with 'bathes' following.</p>

<p>28 <i>1653</i>, less well, '<i>the</i> nectar'.</p>

<p>30 Neat, i' faith!</p>

<p>33 'a lovely <i>brown</i>' as being <i>Fuscara</i>.</p>

<p>35 Here Cleveland dares his 'ill armoury again'; <i>v. sup.</i>, <a href="#page25">p. 25</a>. 'He' <i>1651</i>, <i>1653</i>:
'Her' <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>48 as] <i>1677</i>, unnecessarily, 'like'. Some (baddish) editions '<i>on</i> a bracelet'.</p>

<p>52 Hardly necessary to notice as another of Cleveland's Shakespearian touches.</p>

<p>62 The correcter form is 'lancep<i>e</i>sade'.</p>

<p>70 '<i>Ratillias</i>' <i>1651</i>: '<i>Ratilias</i>' <i>1653</i>: corrected in <i>1677</i>.</p>

<p>71 <i>1677</i>, dropping the verb from 'now's', improves the sense very much.</p>

<p>Pardon, dear Saint, that we so late</p>

<p><i>An Elegy, &amp;c.</i> This and the following piece are among the disputed poems, but as
they occur in <i>1653</i> I give them, with warning and asterisked. The <i>D.N.B.</i> allows
(with a ?) 104 years (1536?-1640) to Chadderton. As the first Master of the House
of pure Emmanuel he might be supposed unlikely to extract a tear from Cleveland.
But he had resigned his Mastership nearly twenty years before his death, and that
death occurred before the troubles became <i>insanabile vulnus</i>. There is nothing to
require special annotation in it, or indeed in either, though in <i>Doctor Chadderton</i>, l. 23,
one may safely guess that either 'thou' or 'now' is an intrusion; in l. 25 of the same
that 'son' should be 'sir', 'sire', 'saint', &amp;c.; and in l. 29 that 'th' Epitaph' is likelier.</p>

<p><i>Mary's Spikenard</i> (<i>1652</i>) of course suggests Crashaw; and yet when one reads it the
thought must surely occur, 'How differently Crashaw would have done it!' I do not
think either is Cleveland's, though the odd string of unrelated conceits in the
Chadderton piece is not unlike him. In the other there is nothing like his usual
style; but it is very pretty, and I will not say he could not have done it as an
exception. But in that case it is a pity he did not make it a rule.</p>

<h3>Upon the King's Return from Scotland.<a name="page86a" id="page86a"></a></h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Returned, I'll ne'er believe 't; first prove him hence;</p>
<p>Kings travel by their beams and influence.</p>
<p>Who says the soul gives out her gests, or goes</p>
<p>A flitting progress 'twixt the head and toes?</p>
<p>She rules by omnipresence, and shall we</p>
<p>Deny a prince the same ubiquity?</p>
<p>Or grant he went, and, 'cause the knot was slack,</p>
<p>Girt both the nations with his zodiac,</p>
<p>Yet as the tree at once both upward shoots,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>And just as much grows downward to the roots,</p>
<p>So at the same time that he posted thither</p>
<p>By counter-stages he rebounded hither.</p>
<p>Hither and hence at once; thus every sphere</p>
<p>Doth by a double motion interfere;</p>
<p>And when his native form inclines him east,</p>
<p>By the first mover he is ravished west.</p>
<p>Have you not seen how the divided dam</p>
<p>Runs to the summons of her hungry lamb;</p>
<p>But when the twin cries halves, she quits the first?</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Nature's commendam must be likewise nursed.</p>
<p>So were his journeys like the spider spun</p>
<p>Out of his bowels of compassion.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[page&nbsp;87]</span>
<p>Two realms, like Cacus, so his steps transpose,</p>
<p>His feet still contradict him as he goes.</p>
<p>England 's returned that was a banished soil.</p>
<p>The bullet flying makes the gun recoil.</p>
<p>Death 's but a separation, though endorsed</p>
<p>With spade and javelin; we were thus divorced.</p>
<p>Our soul hath taken wing while we express</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>The corpse, returning to our principles.</p>
<p>But the Crab-tropic must not now prevail;</p>
<p>Islands go back but when you're under sail.</p>
<p>So his retreat hath rectified that wrong;</p>
<p>Backward is forward in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
<p>Now the Church Militant in plenty rests,</p>
<p>Nor fears, like th' Amazon, to lose her breasts.</p>
<p>Her means are safe; not squeezed until the blood</p>
<p>Mix with the milk and choke the tender brood.</p>
<p>She, that hath been the floating ark, is that</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>She that 's now seated on Mount Ararat.</p>
<p>Quits Charles; our souls did guard him northward thus</p>
<p>Now he the counterpart comes south to us.</p>

<p><i>Upon the King's Return, &amp;c.</i> In 1641&mdash;an ill-omened and unsuccessful journey, which
lasted from August to November. The piece is one of the very few of those in
<i>Cleaveland Revived</i> acknowledged and admitted by <i>Clievelandi Vindiciae</i>.</p>

<p>3 <i>1659</i> 'ghests'; <i>1662</i>, <i>1668</i> 'guests'; <i>1677</i> 'gests'. See <i>N.E.D.</i>, s.v. 'gest' <i>sb.</i><sup>4</sup>.
which defines it as 'the various stages of a journey, especially of a royal progress; the
route followed or planned'.</p>

<p>20 commendam] (misprinted '-dum' from <i>1659</i> to <i>1677</i>). A benefice held with
another; something additional.</p>

<p>21: 'spider' <i>1677</i>; 'spider's' <i>1659</i>, <i>1662</i>, <i>1668</i>.</p>

<p>25 'banished' <i>1677</i>: 'barren' <i>1659</i>, <i>1662</i>, <i>1668</i>.</p>

<p>30 In this very obscure and ultra-Clevelandian line <i>1677</i> reads 'their'. I think 'our'&mdash;the
reading of <i>Cleaveland Revived</i>, followed by <i>1662</i> and <i>1668</i>&mdash;is better. But the
whole poem (one of Cleveland's earliest political attempts) is weak and pithless.</p>

<p>33 'that' <i>1687</i>: 'the' <i>1659</i>, <i>1662</i>, <i>1668</i>.</p>

<p>42 'counterpart' <i>1677</i>: 'counterpane' <i>1659</i>, <i>1662</i>, <i>1668</i>.</p>

<h2>Poems certainly or almost certainly Cleveland's
but not included in 1653 or 1677.</h2>

<p><i>Poems, &amp;c.</i> I have been exceedingly chary of admission under this head, for there seems
to me to be no reasonable <i>via media</i> between such severity and the complete reprinting
of <i>1687</i>&mdash;with perhaps the <i>known</i> larcenies in that and its originals left out. Thus,
of eleven poems given&mdash;but as 'not in <i>1677</i>'&mdash;by Mr. Berdan I have kept but three,
besides one or two which, though not in <i>1677</i>, are in <i>1653</i>, and so appear above. Of
these the Jonson Elegy from <i>Jonsonus Virbius</i> is signed, and as well authenticated as
anything can be; <i>News from Newcastle</i> is quoted by Johnson and therefore of importance
to students of the <i>Lives</i>. The <i>Elegy upon Charles I</i> is in <i>1654</i> among the poems
which that collection adds to <i>1653</i>, is very like him, and relieves Cleveland partly, if not
wholly, from the charge of being wanting to the greatest occasion of his life and calling.</p>

<p><i>An Elegy, &amp;c.</i> Although this appears neither in <i>1653</i> nor in <i>1677</i>, it is included,
with some corruptions not worth noting, in some editions both before and after the
latter. Gifford ascribed to Cleveland another unsigned Elegy in <i>Jonsonus Virbius</i> and
one of the Odes to Ben Jonson on his own Ode to himself, 'Come, quit the loathèd
stage'. There is no authority for the ascription in either case, and the styles of both
pieces are as unlike as possible to Cleveland's.</p>

<p>2 Orig., by a slip, '<i>your</i> own cause'. Cleveland may have meant to address the
poet throughout, or till the last verse; but, if so, he evidently changed his mind.</p>

<h4>Upon the Coal-pits about Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</h4>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>England 's a perfect world, has Indies too;</p>
<p>Correct your maps, Newcastle is Peru!</p>
<p>Let th' haughty Spaniard triumph till 'tis told</p>
<p>Our sooty min'rals purify his gold.</p>
<p>This will sublime and hatch the abortive ore,</p>
<p>When the sun tires and stars can do no more.</p>
<p>No! mines are current, unrefined, and gross;</p>
<p>Coals make the sterling, Nature but the dross.</p>
<p>For metals, Bacchus-like, two births approve;</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Heaven's heat 's the Semele, and ours the Jove.</p>
<p>Thus Art doth polish Nature; 'tis her trade:</p>
<p>So every madam has her chambermaid.</p>
<p class="i2">Who'd dote on gold?  A thing so strange and odd,</p>
<p>'Tis most contemptible when made a god!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[page&nbsp;89]</span>
<p>All sins and mischiefs thence have rise and swell;</p>
<p>One Indies more would make another Hell.</p>
<p>Our mines are innocent, nor will the North</p>
<p>Tempt poor mortality with too much worth.</p>
<p>Th' are not so precious; rich enough to fire</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>A lover, yet make none idolater.</p>
<p>The moderate value of our guiltless ore</p>
<p>Makes no man atheist, nor no woman whore.</p>
<p>Yet why should hallowed Vesta's glowing shrine</p>
<p>Deserve more honour than a flaming mine?</p>
<p>These pregnant wombs of heat would fitter be,</p>
<p>Than a few embers, for a deity.</p>
<p>Had he our pits, the Persian would admire</p>
<p>No sun, but warm 's devotion at our fire.</p>
<p>He'd leave the trotting Whipster, and prefer</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>This profound Vulcan 'bove that Wagoner.</p>
<p>For wants he heat, or light? would he have store</p>
<p>Of both? 'Tis here. And what can suns give more?</p>
<p>Nay, what 's that sun but, in a different name,</p>
<p>A coal-pit rampant, or a mine on flame?</p>
<p>Then let this truth reciprocally run,</p>
<p>The sun 's Heaven's coalery, and coals our sun;</p>
<p>A sun that scorches not, locked up i' th' deep;</p>
<p>The bandog 's chained, the lion is asleep.</p>
<p>That tyrant fire, which uncontrolled doth rage,</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Here 's calm and hushed, like Bajazet i' th' cage.</p>
<p>For in each coal-pit there doth couchant dwell</p>
<p>A muzzled Etna, or an innocent Hell.</p>
<p>Kindle the cloud, you'll lightning then descry;</p>
<p>Then will a day break from the gloomy sky;</p>
<p>Then you'll unbutton though December blow,</p>
<p>And sweat i' th' midst of icicles and snow;</p>
<p>The dog-days then at Christmas. Thus is all</p>
<p>The year made June and equinoctial.</p>
<p>If heat offend, our pits afford us shade,</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Thus summer 's winter, winter 's summer made.</p>
<p>What need we baths, what need we bower or grove?</p>
<p>A coal-pit's both a ventiduct and stove.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[page&nbsp;90]</span>
<p>Such pits and caves were palaces of old;</p>
<p>Poor inns, God wot, yet in an age of gold;</p>
<p>And what would now be thought a strange design,</p>
<p>To build a house was then to undermine.</p>
<p>People lived under ground, and happy dwellers</p>
<p>Whose jovial habitations were all cellars!</p>
<p>These primitive times were innocent, for then</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Man, who turned after fox, but made his den.</p>
<p class="i2">But see a fleet of rivals trim and fine,</p>
<p>To court the rich infanta of our mine;</p>
<p>Hundreds of grim Leanders dare confront,</p>
<p>For this loved Hero, the loud Hellespont.</p>
<p>'Tis an armado royal doth engage</p>
<p>For some new Helen with this equipage;</p>
<p>Prepared too, should we their addresses bar,</p>
<p>To force their mistress with a ten years' war,</p>
<p>But that our mine 's a common good, a joy</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Made not to ruin but enrich our Troy.</p>
<p>Thus went those gallant heroes of old Greece,</p>
<p>The Argonauts, in quest o' th' Golden Fleece.</p>
<p>But oh! these bring it with 'em and conspire</p>
<p>To pawn that idol for our smoke and fire.</p>
<p>Silver 's but ballast; this they bring ashore</p>
<p>That they may treasure up our better ore.</p>
<p>For this they venter rocks and storms, defy</p>
<p>All the extremities of sea and sky.</p>
<p>For the glad purchase of this precious mould,</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Cowards dare pirates, misers part with gold.</p>
<p>Hence 'tis that when the doubtful ship sets forth</p>
<p>The knowing needle still directs it north,</p>
<p>And Nature's secret wonder, to attest</p>
<p>Our Indies' worth, discards both east and west.</p>
<p class="i2">For 'tis not only fire commends this spring,</p>
<p>A coal-pit is a mine of everything.</p>
<p>We sink a jack-of-all-trades shop, and sound</p>
<p>An inversed Burse, an Exchange under ground.</p>
<p>This Proteus earth converts to what you'd ha' 't:</p>
<p><span class="right1">90</span>Now you may weave 't to silk, then coin 't to plate,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[page&nbsp;91]</span>
<p>And, what 's a metamorphosis more dear,</p>
<p>Dissolve it and 'twill melt to London beer.</p>
<p>For whatsoe'er that gaudy city boasts,</p>
<p>Each month derives to these attractive coasts.</p>
<p>We shall exhaust their chamber and devour</p>
<p>Their treasures of Guildhall, the Mint, the Tower.</p>
<p>Our staiths their mortgaged streets will soon divide,</p>
<p>Blathon owe Cornhill, Stella share Cheapside.</p>
<p>Thus will our coal-pits' charity and pity</p>
<p><span class="right1">100</span>At distance undermine and fire the City.</p>
<p>Should we exact, they'd pawn their wives and treat</p>
<p>To swap those coolers for our sovereign heat.</p>
<p>'Bove kisses and embraces fire controls;</p>
<p>No Venus heightens like a peck of coals.</p>
<p>Medea was the drudge of some old sire</p>
<p>And Aeson's bath a lusty sea-coal fire.</p>
<p>Chimneys are old men's mistresses, their inns,</p>
<p>A modern dalliance with their measled shins.</p>
<p>To all defects the coal-heap brings a cure,</p>
<p><span class="right1">110</span>Gives life to age and raiment to the poor.</p>
<p>Pride first wore clothes; Nature disdains attire;</p>
<p>She made us naked 'cause she gave us fire.</p>
<p>Full wharfs are wardrobes, and the tailor's charm</p>
<p>Belongs to th' collier;  he must keep us warm.</p>
<p>The quilted alderman with all 's array</p>
<p>Finds but cold comfort on a frosty day;</p>
<p>Girt, wrapped, and muffled, yet with all that stir</p>
<p>Scarce warm when smoth'red in his drowsy fur;</p>
<p>Not proof against keen Winter's batteries</p>
<p><span class="right1">120</span>Should he himself wear all 's own liveries,</p>
<p>But chilblains under silver spurs bewails</p>
<p>And in embroid'red buckskins blows his nails.</p>
<p class="i2">Rich meadows and full crops are elsewhere found:</p>
<p>We can reap harvest from our barren ground.</p>
<p>The bald parched hills that circumscribe our Tyne</p>
<p>Are no less fruitful in their hungry mine.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[page&nbsp;92]</span>
<p>Their unfledged tops so well content our palates,</p>
<p>We envy none their nosegays and their sallets.</p>
<p>A gay rank soil like a young gallant grows</p>
<p><span class="right1">130</span>And spends itself that it may wear fine clothes,</p>
<p>Whilst all its worth is to its back confined.</p>
<p>Our wear 's plain outside, but is richly lined;</p>
<p>Winter 's above, 'tis summer underneath,</p>
<p>A trusty morglay in a rusty sheath.</p>
<p>As precious sables sometimes interlace</p>
<p>A wretched serge or grogram cassock case.</p>
<p>Rocks own no spring, are pregnant with no showers,</p>
<p>Crystals and gems grow there instead of flowers;</p>
<p>Instead of roses, beds of rubies sweat</p>
<p><span class="right1">140</span>And emeralds recompense the violet.</p>
<p>Dame Nature not, like other madams, wears,</p>
<p>Where she is bare, pearls on her breasts or ears.</p>
<p>What though our fields present a naked sight?</p>
<p>A paradise should be an adamite.</p>
<p>The northern lad his bonny lass throws down</p>
<p>And gives her a black bag for a green gown.</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Were not my faith buoyed up by sacred blood,</p>
<p>It might be drowned in this prodigious flood;</p>
<p>Which reason's highest ground doth so exceed,</p>
<p>It leaves my soul no anch'rage but my creed;</p>
<p>Where my faith, resting on th' original,</p>
<p>Supports itself in this, the copy's fall.</p>
<p>So while my faith floats on that bloody wood,</p>
<p>My reason 's cast away in this red flood</p>
<p>Which near o'erflows us all. Those showers past</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Made but land-floods, which did some valleys waste.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[page&nbsp;93]</span>
<p>This stroke hath cut the only neck of land</p>
<p>Which between us and this red sea did stand,</p>
<p>That covers now our world which curséd lies</p>
<p>At once with two of Egypt's prodigies</p>
<p>(O'ercast with darkness and with blood o'errun),</p>
<p>And justly since our hearts have theirs outdone.</p>
<p>Th' enchanter led them to a less known ill</p>
<p>To act his sin, than 'twas their king to kill;</p>
<p>Which crime hath widowed our whole nation,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Voided all forms, left but privation</p>
<p>In Church and State; inverting every right;</p>
<p>Brought in Hell's state of fire without light.</p>
<p>No wonder then if all good eyes look red,</p>
<p>Washing their loyal hearts from blood so shed;</p>
<p>The which deserves each pore should turn an eye</p>
<p>To weep out even a bloody agony.</p>
<p>Let nought then pass for music but sad cries,</p>
<p>For beauty bloodless cheeks and blood-shot eyes.</p>
<p>All colours soil but black; all odours have</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>Ill scent but myrrh, incens'd upon this grave.</p>
<p>It notes a Jew not to believe us much</p>
<p>The cleaner made by a religious touch</p>
<p>Of this dead body, whom to judge to die</p>
<p>Seems the Judaical impiety.</p>
<p>To kill the King, the Spirit Legion paints</p>
<p>His rage with law, the Temple and the saints.</p>
<p>But the truth is, he feared and did repine</p>
<p>To be cast out and back into the swine.</p>
<p>And the case holds, in that the Spirit bends</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>His malice in this act against his ends;</p>
<p>For it is like the sooner he'll be sent</p>
<p>Out of that body he would still torment.</p>
<p>Let Christians then use otherwise this blood;</p>
<p>Detest the act, yet turn it to their good;</p>
<p>Thinking how like a King of Death he dies</p>
<p>We easily may the world and death despise.</p>
<p>Death had no sting for him and its sharp arm,</p>
<p>Only of all the troop, meant him no harm.</p>
<p>And so he looked upon the axe as one</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Weapon yet left to guard him to his throne.</p>
<p>In his great name then may his subjects cry,</p>
<p>'Death, thou art swallowed up in victory.'</p>
<p>If this, our loss, a comfort can admit,</p>
<p>'Tis that his narrowed crown is grown unfit</p>
<p>For his enlargéd head, since his distress</p>
<p>Had greatened this, as it made that the less.</p>
<p>His crown was fallen unto too low a thing</p>
<p>For him who was become so great a king.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[page&nbsp;94]</span>
<p>So the same hands enthroned him in that crown</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>They had exalted from him, not pulled down.</p>
<p>And thus God's truth by them hath rendered more</p>
<p>Than e'er man's falsehood promised to restore;</p>
<p>Which, since by death alone he could attain,</p>
<p>Was yet exempt from weakness and from pain.</p>
<p>Death was enjoined by God to touch a part,</p>
<p>Might make his passage quick, ne'er move his heart,</p>
<p>Which even expiring was so far from death</p>
<p>It seemed but to command away his breath.</p>
<p>And thus his soul, of this her triumph proud,</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Broke like a flash of lightning through the cloud</p>
<p>Of flesh and blood; and from the highest line</p>
<p>Of human virtue, passed to be divine.</p>
<p>Nor is 't much less his virtues to relate</p>
<p>Than the high glories of his present state.</p>
<p>Since both, then, pass all acts but of belief,</p>
<p>Silence may praise the one, the other grief.</p>
<p>And since upon the diamond no less</p>
<p>Than diamonds will serve us to impress,</p>
<p>I'll only wish that for his elegy</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THOMAS STANLEY</h2>

<p>Thomas Stanley, poet, scholar, translator, and historian of philosophy,
occupies a position in literary history, and in the general knowledge of
fairly instructed people, which is less unenviable than that of Cleveland,
almost equally curious, but more distinctly accidental. In a way&mdash;in more ways
than one&mdash;he cannot be said to be exactly unknown. Everybody who has
received the once usual 'liberal education', if not directly acquainted with his
work on classical literature, has seen his <i>History of Philosophy</i> referred
to in later histories; and his notes on Aeschylus quoted, and sometimes fought
over, in later editions. His translations have attained a place in that
private-adventure Valhalla of English translations&mdash;Bohn's Library. A few at least
of his poems are in all or most of the anthologies. Not many writers have
such an anchor with four flukes, lodged in the general memory, as this.
And yet there are probably few people who have any very distinct knowledge
or idea of his work as a whole; his <i>Poems</i> (until a time subsequent to the
original promise of them in this Collection) had never been issued since his
own day save in one of the few-copied reprints of the indefatigable Sir
Egerton Brydges; and he makes small figure in most literary histories.</p>

<p>The reasons of this, however, are not very far to seek. For a very
considerable time during the later seventeenth and the whole of the eighteenth
century, if not later, Stanley was a recognized authority on history and
scholarship: but during this time a philosopher and a scholar would have
been usually thought to derogate, strangely and not quite pardonably, by
writing and translating love poetry in a style of 'false wit' the most contrary
to the precepts of Mr. Addison. We cannot even be sure that Stanley himself
would not have been short-sighted enough to feel a certain shame at his
harmless <i>fredaines</i> in verse, for he certainly never published or fully
collected them at all after he was six and twenty, though he lived to double that
age. He seems, moreover, though most forward to help other men of
letters, to have been in all other ways a decidedly retiring person&mdash;a man of
books rather than of affairs. Though an unquestioned Royalist, and not
accused of any dishonourable compliance, he seems to have been quite undisturbed
during the Civil War, no doubt because of his observation of the
precept <ins title="Greek: lathe biôsas">&lambda;&#8049;&theta;&epsilon; &beta;&iota;&#8061;&sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf;</ins>. In short, he took no trouble to keep himself
before any public except the public of letters, and the public of letters chose to
keep him only in his capacity as scholar.</p>

<p>If, however, he put himself not forward it was not for want of means and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[page&nbsp;98]</span>
opportunity to do so. After some mistakes about his genealogy, it has been
made certain that he was descended, though with the bend sinister, from
the great house that bears the same name, and through a branch which
enriched itself by commerce and settled in Hertfordshire and Essex. His
mother was a Hammond of the family which has been referred to in dealing
with his uncle the poet (vol. ii), and he was also connected with Sandys,
Lovelace, and Sherburne, all of whom were his intimate friends, as were
John Hall and Shirley the dramatist. He seems always to have been
a man of means: and used them liberally, though less thoughtlessly than
Benlowes, in assisting brother men of letters. He is not said to have been
at any of the great schools, but his private tutor William Fairfax (son of
Edward of Tasso fame) appears to have grounded him thoroughly in scholarship.
At thirteen he went to Pembroke College (then Hall), Cambridge,
entering in June 1639 and matriculating in December. He is said to have
entered at Oxford next year. He was co-opted at Cambridge in 1642 as
(apparently) a gentleman pensioner or commoner. He married early, his
wife's name being Dorothy Enyon, and they had several children, of whom
four survived him when he died, in 1678, at Suffolk Street, St.
Martin's-in-the-Fields.</p>

<p>There is a tendency&mdash;which is perhaps rather slightly unfair than
positively unjust&mdash;to suspect a poet who is specially given to translation:
and not exactly to discard the suspicion in the ratio of his excellence as
a translator. The reason behind this is sufficient, as has been said, to free
it from the charge of positive injustice as a general rule, for it may be
plausibly contended that a true poet, with nature and his own soul to draw
upon, will not experience any great necessity to go to some one else for
matter. But these general rules are always dangerous in particular
application, and therefore it has been said that the notion is not quite fair.
In fact, if it is examined as it does apply to individuals, it becomes clear
that it will not do as a general rule at all&mdash;that like some other general
rules it is practically useless. That Chaucer was <i>grant translateur</i> may
be said to be neither here nor there in the circumstances. But Spenser
did not disdain translation; Dryden evidently did it for love as well as
for money, though the latter may have been its chief attraction for Pope;
and a poet such as Shelley, who was very nearly <i>the</i> poet, by no means
despised it.</p>

<p>When, however, we come to examine Stanley's work we may perhaps
discover something in the very excellence of his translations which connects
itself usefully with his original poems. These translations are excellent
because he has almost unerringly selected writers who are suitable to the
poetical style of his own day, and has transposed them into English verse
of that style. But in his original poems there is perhaps a little too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[page&nbsp;99]</span>
suggestion of something not wholly dissimilar. They are (pretty as they
almost always are, and beautiful as they sometimes are) a little devoid
of the spontaneity and <i>élan</i> which distinguish the best things of the time
from Carew and Crashaw down to Kynaston and John Hall. There is
a very little of the <i>exercise</i> about them. Moreover, not quite as a
necessary
consequence of this, there is a want of decided character. Stanley is
much more a typical minor Caroline poet than he is Stanley, and so much
must needs be said critically in these volumes on the type that it seems
unnecessary to repeat it on an individual who gives that type with
little idiosyncrasy, even while giving it in some abundance and with real
charm. Only let it be added that we could not have a better foil to
Cleveland, who, though unpolished, is always 'Manly, Sir, manly!' than
this scholarly and graceful but somewhat epicene poet.</p>

<p>There are, however, some peculiarities about his work which made me slow
to make up my mind about the fashion of presenting it. His translations
are numerous: but this collection was not originally intended to include
translations unless they were inextricably connected with issues of original
work, or where, as in Godolphin's case, there was a special reason.
Further, the translations, which are from a large number of authors, ancient
and modern, sometimes include prose as well as verse. Thirdly, even
the original poems were cross-issued in widely different arrangements. In
short, the thing was rather a muddle, and though no one has occupied me
in my various visits to the British Museum and the Bodleian during the
past ten or twelve years oftener than Stanley, I postponed him from
volume to volume. At last, and very recently a feasible plan suggested
itself&mdash;to give the edition of 1651 as Brydges had done, this being after all
the only one which at once represents revision and definite literary
purpose, and to let the translations in this represent&mdash;as the poet seems
himself to have selected them to do&mdash;his translating habits and studies.
Before these I have printed the original poems of the first or 1647 edition,
and after them the few which he seems to have allowed to be added to the
set versions in Gamble's <i>Airs and Dialogues</i> ten years later. I think this
will put Stanley on a fair level with the rest of our flock. Those who
want his classical translations from Anacreon, Ausonius, the Idylls, and
the <i>Pervigilium</i>, as well as from Johannes Secundus, will not have much
difficulty in finding them; and I did not see my way to load this volume
with Preti's <i>Oronta</i>, Montalvan's <i>Aurora</i>, &amp;c. The bibliography of
these things is rather complicated, and I do not pretend to have followed it out
exhaustively. In fact this is certainly the case as far as my own collations of
1647, made at the British Museum, and those furnished me from the Bodleian
copy are concerned.<a id="footnotetagits1" name="footnotetagits1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnoteits1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the differences are rarely of importance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[page&nbsp;100]</span>
1647, a private issue, was reprinted in 1650 and 1651: while Gamble's
<i>Airs and Dialogues</i> appeared in 1656 and was reissued with a fresh
title-page in 1657. In the latter year Stanley furnished another composer&mdash;John
Wilson, Professor of Music at Oxford&mdash;with the letterpress of
<i>Psalterium Carolinum</i>, the King's devotions from the <i>Eikon</i>
versified. His <i>History of Philosophy</i> appeared in 1655: his <i>Aeschylus</i> in 1663.</p>

<p>Some years ago (London, 1893) a beautiful illustrated edition of his
<i>Anacreon</i> appeared, and more recently&mdash;but, as I have noted, after the
announcement of this collection&mdash;a carefully arranged and collated edition
of the original <i>Lyrics</i> with a few selected translations (Tutin, Hull,
1907), edited by Miss L. Imogen Guiney. I have not found Miss Guiney's work
useless, and if I have occasionally had to question her emendations that is
only a matter of course.</p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnoteits1" name="footnoteits1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagits1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am informed by three subsequent collators more experienced in such work than
myself&mdash;Mr. Percy Simpson, Mr. Thorn-Drury, and a Clarendon Press reader&mdash;that
they have not found some differences which my own comparison-notes of some years
ago seemed to show between the British Museum and the Bodleian copies of 1647.
No doubt they are right. Some of the dates given above have also been corrected by
them.</p>

<p>Since I (with thee) have lost the scope</p>

<p>Whence took the diamond worth? the borrow'd rays</p>
<p>That crystal wears, whence had they first their praise?</p>
<p>Why should rude feet contemn the snow's chaste white,</p>
<p>Which from the sun receives a sparkling light,</p>
<p>Brighter than diamonds far, and by its birth</p>
<p>Decks the green garment of the richer earth?</p>

<p>Taking their praise the other to adorn.</p>
<p>Thus blind is human sight: opinion gave</p>

despises this as a mere commonplace love-poem to note&mdash;if he can&mdash;the splendid swell
of the verse to the fourth line, and then the 'turn' of the final couplet. With Stanley
and his generation that swell and turn passed&mdash;never to reappear till William Blake
revived it nearly a century and a half afterwards.</p>

for 'cold' and 'near'; l. 15 (entirely different)</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">

  </div>  </div>

<p>l. 16 'the' for 'thy'; and in the closing distich '<i>Thus</i> let me not' and '<i>Either</i> or both'.
The interest of this piece is almost wholly centred on the penultimate line, which, being
an evident and intended contradiction to</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">

Apuleius, but rather less credibly as a latinizing of Menander's
<ins title="Greek: Anechomenos">&#7944;&nu;&epsilon;&chi;&#8057;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>.

obviously intended to end that collection, but a number of unpaged leaves were subsequently
added containing the complimentary verses addressed to Fletcher and others.
The following variants occur: 11 'by thy kind power unbound'. 12 'At least with
freedom, though not conquest crown'd'. 14 'Suspends these papers'. Stanley also
appended a list of Greek quotations justifying the cento. There is an intrinsic interest
attaching to them in that they <i>may</i> have suggested a similar process to Gray. A further
comparison-contrast may also interest some as to the lines themselves&mdash;that of the
famous and magnificent opening of Mr. Swinburne's <i>Tristram of Lyonesse</i>.</p>

<p>The notes annotate the following phrases:&mdash;1 '(<i>a</i>) all passions', 2 '(<i>b</i>) Youngest
and (<i>c</i>) oldest', 3 '(<i>d</i>) Born', 4 '(<i>e</i>) Moves', 7 '(<i>f</i>) By thy mysterious ...' The

<h3><i>The Glow-worm.</i></h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Stay, fairest Chariessa, stay and mark</p>
<p>This animated gem, whose fainter spark</p>
<p>Of fading light its birth had from the dark.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A Star thought by the erring passenger,</p>
<p>Which falling from its native orb dropt here,</p>
<p>And makes the earth (its centre) now its sphere.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Should many of these sparks together be,</p>
<p>He that the unknown light far off should see,</p>
<p>Would think it a terrestrial Galaxy.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Take 't up, fair Saint;  see how it mocks thy fright!</p>
<p>The paler flame doth not yield heat, though light,</p>
<p>Which thus deceives thy reason, through thy sight.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But see how quickly it (ta'en up) doth fade,</p>
<p>To shine in darkness only being made,</p>
<p>By th' brightness of thy light turn'd to a shade;</p>

<p>And burnt to ashes by thy flaming eyes,</p>
<p>On the chaste altar of thy hand it dies,</p>
<p>As to thy greater light a sacrifice.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>The Glow-worm</i>.] Sir Egerton Brydges thought that 'A stile of poetry so full of quaint
and far-fetched conceits cannot be commended as the most chaste and classical'; but
that, 'among trifles of this kind, <i>The Glow-worm</i> is singularly elegant and happy'.
Perhaps a later judgement, while waiving the indispensableness, or even pre-eminence,
of chastity and classicality in verse, may doubt whether <i>The Glow-worm</i> itself is not
rather too 'elegant' to be as 'happy' as some other things even of its author's. The last
verse redeems it, though, to some extent.</p>

<p>2 <i>1647</i> 'This living star of earth'. I suppose Stanley did not like the recurrence of
'star', or he may have thought that the same sound (-<i>ar</i>) recurred still more excessively
in the rhymes. In itself the earlier reading is certainly the better.</p>

<h3><i>The Breath.</i></h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Favonius the milder breath o' th' Spring,</p>
<p>When proudly bearing on his softer wing</p>
<p>Rich odours, which from the Panchean groves</p>
<p>He steals, as by the Phoenix' pyre he moves,</p>
<p>Profusely doth his sweeter theft dispense</p>
<p>To the next rose's blushing innocence,</p>
<p>But from the grateful flower, a richer scent</p>
<p>He back receives than he unto it lent.</p>
<p>Then laden with his odours' richest store,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>He to thy breath hastes; to which these are poor!</p>
<p>Which whilst the amorous wind to steal essays,</p>
<p>He like a wanton Lover 'bout thee plays,</p>
<p>And sometimes cooling thy soft cheek doth lie,</p>
<p>And sometimes burning at thy flaming eye:</p>
<p>Drawn in at last by that breath we implore,</p>
<p>He now returns far sweeter than before,</p>
<p>And rich by being robb'd, in thee he finds</p>
<p>The burning sweets of Pyres, the cool of Winds.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>The Breath</i>.] This appears in all three editions, <i>1656</i> following <i>1647</i> in the following

double rhymes in stanza 3, which break the note (those at the end of st. 4 do not).
There are no variants; the poem is not in <i>1647</i>. But Miss Guiney has proposed
to substitute 'hearts' for 'they' in the last line.</p>

<p><i>The Return&mdash;(Palinode.)</i>] The <i>1647</i> edition contains <i>two</i> poems, <i>The Return</i> and <i>Palinode</i>,
which stand to each other in a curious relation. In <i>1651</i> <i>Palinode</i> has disappeared.
I have thought it best to print them together. The lines in roman type are those of <i>The
Return</i>, those in italic belong to <i>Palinode</i>. The latter reappeared in <i>1657</i>, with slight
alterations as below. In <i>Pal.</i> 5 Miss Guiney reads 'would' for 'wouldst', evidently
not quite understanding the sense or the grammar of the time. The second person
connects itself with the vocative in 'Beauty' and the 'thou' twice implied in 'thy'.</p>

<p>In <i>Palinode</i>, l. 7, <i>1657</i> reads 'powerful' for 'potent'; l. 12 'in' for 'at'.</p>

<p>In <i>The Return</i>, l. 2, <i>1651</i> 'unite'&mdash;an obvious misprint; l. 3, <i>1647</i> 'bound'; l. 5,
<i>1647</i> 'That', <i>1651</i> 'Thou'; l. 10, <i>1657</i> 'which' for 'that'; l. 11, 'twixt'&mdash;not so
well; l. 13, 'the' is dropped by mere accident in <i>1651</i>&mdash;'the', not 'th',' is required.</p>

<p><i>Commanded by his Mistress, &amp;c.</i>] Marino[i]'s name is so frequent in books on literature,
and his work so little known to the ordinary reader, that this example may be
welcome. The rather snip-snap antithesis, and the somewhat obvious conceit, show the
famous Italian really at his worst. 'President' (l. 1), though not impossible, is
probably for 'pre<i>ce</i>dent'. The whole piece has a special interest as showing how this
'conceit' and 'false wit' actually encouraged the growth of the stopped antithetic
couplet which was to be turned against both.</p>

<p><i>The Tomb</i>.] Brydges, though thinking the end of this poem 'a feeble conceit', admits
that 'there are passages in it that are more than pretty'. It is certainly one of
Stanley's best, and he seems to have taken some trouble with it. In <i>1651</i> he dropped
the bracketed stanza 3 and substituted the text for the last couplet of stanza 2, which
reads in <i>1647</i>:</p>

In the last line of the omitted stanza 'love' is certainly wrong, and Miss Guiney's suggestion
of 'kill' is almost <i>certissima</i>. But she seems to have had a different copy of
<i>1647</i> before her from that which I collated, for she does not notice a variant, or set of
variants, in ll. 37-9:

<p>6 Miss Guiney insists, in the teeth of all texts, upon changing over 'thy' and 'her',
saying that 'facts and the context force' the reversal. I am afraid that the genius of
seventeenth-century poetry did not care much for facts or context at any time. But
here no violence is done to either. Nine men out of ten wishing to say 'to make out
of the spoil of herself an ornament for thee' would have probably put it in the same
way, especially if they wanted the rhyme 'spoil'.</p>

He has thrown away the half-sad, half-scornful burst of the opening 'Quand
vous serez bien vieille'&mdash;the vivid picture of the crone half boasting, half regretting her
love and her disdain, by the flicker of fire and candle, to the listening handmaiden, and
the final touch as to the use of life. In fact I have sometimes wondered whether he
really meant this masterpiece.</p>

<p><i>The Loss</i>.] Still good. But I have once more to demur to Miss Guiney's opinion that
'Thy' in l. 20, though found in all texts, should 'almost certainly' be 'Their'. In
the first place, conjectural emendations in the teeth of text-agreement are never to be
made without absolute necessity. In the second, the hackneyed observation about the
less obvious reading is never so true as of the Caroline poets. In the third, this particular
correction, if obvious in one sense, is but specious in another, and '<i>Their</i> faith'
will be found on examination to make less, not more, sense than 'Thy'. The meaning
is, 'Such faith as thou mightest repose in them after being false to me', i.e. 'They
would leave thee for other light-o'-loves'.</p>

changed over; in l. 19, 'doth' (again reflecting the immediate presentation). In l. 29
'rise': the form 'ris'' is recognized by Ben Jonson. In l. 30 Miss Guiney thinks 'not'
'clearly a misprint' for 'with'. But this is clearly a misunderstanding of 'expir'd',
which is used with its proper transitive force as in Latin. 'Had not the dying stage

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>That wise philosopher, who had design'd</p>
<p>To life the various passions of the mind,</p>
<p>Did wrong'd Medea's jealousy prefer</p>
<p>To entertain the Roman theatre;</p>
<p>Both to instruct the soul, and please the sight,</p>
<p>At once begetting horror and delight.</p>
<p class="i2">This cruelty thou dost once more express,</p>
<p>Though in a strange, no less becoming dress;</p>
<p>And her revenge hast robb'd of half its pride,</p>

<p>But what thou gav'st to us, with equal light</p>
<p>Thou wouldst bestow on him, nor wert more just</p>
<p>Unto the author's work, than to his dust;</p>
<p>Thou dost make good his title, aid his claim,</p>
<p>Both vindicate his poem and his name,</p>
<p>So shar'st a double wreath; for all that we</p>
<p>Unto the poet owe, he owes to thee.      20</p>
<p>Though change of tongues stol'n praise to some afford,</p>

'To Mr. E. S. on his Translation of Medea, with the other Tragedies of Seneca the

the rather capriciously adjudged honour of appearing in Chalmers's <i>Poets</i>, which
accounts for his absence here.</p>

<p>Thy prince and rulers, nor their laws despise:</p>
<p>Thy parents reverence, and near allies:</p>
<p>Him that is first in virtue make thy friend;</p>
<p>And with observance his kind speech attend:</p>
<p>Nor, to thy power, for light faults cast him by;</p>
<p>Thy power is neighbour to necessity.</p>
<p class="i2">These know, and with intentive care pursue;</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>But Anger, Sloth, and Luxury subdue.</p>

<p>Let Justice all thy words and actions sway,</p>
<p>Nor from the even course of reason stray;</p>
<p>For know that all men are to die ordain'd,</p>
<p>And riches are as quickly lost as gain'd.</p>
<p>Crosses that happen by divine decree,</p>
<p>If such thy lot, bear not impatiently.</p>
<p>Yet seek to remedy with all thy care,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>And think the just have not the greatest share.</p>
<p>'Mongst men discourses good and bad are spread,</p>

<p>Let not men's smoother promises invite,</p>

<p>Nor do what afterward thou mayst repent,</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>First learn to know the thing on which th'art bent.</p>

<p>How Nature is by general likeness chain'd.</p>
<p>Vain Hope nor Ignorance shall dim thy sight:</p>
<p>Then shalt thou see that hapless men invite</p>

<p>And few the cure of their misfortunes find:</p>
<p>This only is the fate that harms, and rolls,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Through miseries successive, human souls.</p>
<p>Within is a continual hidden fight,</p>
<p>Which we to shun must study, not excite:</p>
<p>Good God! how little trouble should we know,</p>

<p class="i2">But fear not thou; men come of heav'nly race,</p>
<p>Taught by diviner Nature what t' embrace;</p>
<p>Which, if pursued, thou all I nam'd shalt gain,</p>
<p>And keep thy soul clear from thy body's stain:</p>
<p>In time of prayer and cleansing meats denied</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Abstain from; thy mind's reins let reason guide:</p>

and <i>Iamblichus</i>, who affirm that the rules and sense only were his,
digested
into verse by some of his scholars. But it is not improbable that they did
no more than collect the verses, and so gave occasion to the mistake; for

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO HENRY KING.</h2>

<p>Among the numerous possible extensions of that practice of writing
<i>Dialogues of the Dead</i> which has been, at various times, rather unusually
justified of its practitioners, not the least tempting would be one which
should embody the expectations and the disappointment of the pious
Bishop who held the see of Chichester in Fuller's Bad and Better Times&mdash;long
afterwards, between 1843 and 1888. In the former year, as most
students of English poetry know, the late Archdeacon Hannah, then
a young Fellow of Lincoln College, published a most admirable edition
of part of King's <i>Poems</i>; and announced that the rest must be left for a
separate volume 'which will be published without delay'. He lived forty-five
years longer, and 'the rest' was by no means an extensive one; but,
whatever may have been the reason,<a id="footnotetagihk1" name="footnotetagihk1"></a><a href="#footnoteihk1"><sup>1</sup></a> the second volume never appeared,
while, to complete the misfortune, King's one famous thing, the beautiful</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Tell me no more how fair she is&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>is not in the first. Nor has any one since attempted to supply the
deficiency,<a id="footnotetagihk2" name="footnotetagihk2"></a><a href="#footnoteihk2"><sup>2</sup></a>
though that benefactor of the lovers of Caroline poetry, Mr. J. R. Tutin,
included a fifteen-page selection of King's poems, with Donne and Walton,
in one of his 'Orinda Booklets' (Hull, 1904) some little time after the plan
of this collection was announced, and when its first volume was passing
through the press.</p>

<p>There must have been many readers who, like the present writer long
enough ago, have felt a sensation of mingled amazement and chagrin on
buying Dr. Hannah's book and <i>not</i> finding 'Tell me no more' in it. For
that poem, though in certain 'strange and high' qualities it is the inferior
of the best jets of the Caroline genius, is one of the most faultless and
perfect things in this or indeed in any period of English poetry, and may be
said to impart the Caroline essence in a form that can be (in the medical
sense) 'borne' by all who have any feeling for poetry at all, as hardly
anything else does. It enlists, with unerring art, the peculiar virtue of the
metre&mdash;that of expressing settled but not violent hopelessness&mdash;which
Cowper afterwards utilized, more terribly but hardly more skilfully, in 'The
Castaway'. It has the 'metaphysical' fancifulness of thought and diction,
tempered to a reasonable but not an excessive degree 'below proof' and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[page&nbsp;164]</span>
fit for general consumption. No one who possesses literary 'curiosity'&mdash;in
the good old sense, not the degenerate modern one&mdash;can be indifferent
to seeing what else the author of this could do.</p>

<p>It may be frankly and at once admitted that he has nothing exactly
to match it. The once even more famous&mdash;and still perhaps not much
less famous&mdash;<i>Sic Vita</i>, is not certainly his; and, though a fine thing, is very
distinctly open to the metaphysical reproach of <i>playing with</i> its subject too
much&mdash;of that almost wilfully mechanical and factory-like conceit-mongering
which reaches its extreme in Cleveland. If it is King's, 'The Dirge' is
a sort of extended handling of it&mdash;less epigrammatic but more poetical, and
brought down again to that <i>via media</i> of metaphysicality which is King's
special path. He is, in fact, a sort of Longfellow of this particular style
and school of poetry&mdash;from the other side; a sort of Donne <i>in usum vulgi</i>.
'The Exequy' and 'The Elegy', 'Silence' and 'Brave Flowers', are all in
this middle way; and perhaps his treading of it may be a reason why he has
been comparatively neglected&mdash;the great vulgar not being grateful for poetry
which never can fully please it, and the small wanting something more concentrated
and '<i>above</i> proof'. But even if he had not lacked complete presentment
so long, such a collection as this would be manifestly incomplete
without him. It has not, however, been thought necessary to include his verse
translations of the Psalms, which form a separate volume, not much more
successful than most of the attempts at that impossible task. With the
admirable English of the Authorized or the Prayer-Book Versions at
choice, and the admirable Latin of the Vulgate to fall back upon, nobody
can want stuff like</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Earth is the Lord's with her increase,</p>
<p class="i2">And all that there have place:</p>
<p>He founded it upon the Seas,</p>
<p class="i2">And made the floods her base.<a id="footnotetagihk3" name="footnotetagihk3"></a><a href="#footnoteihk3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Henry King's private and public history (for he had more to do with public
affairs than can have been at all comfortable to himself) had no very
obvious connexion with poetry, except in so far as circumstances fed what
was clearly a special taste of his for elegiac writing. He was born in 1592
at Worminghall in Bucks., for some time the abode of a family which,
whether its tracing to 'the ancient Kings [by function, not name merely] of
Devonshire' was fiction or fact, was, and had been for generations, highly
respectable. The Kings had recently addicted themselves very specially
to education at Westminster and Christ Church (there are said to have
been five of the same family on the books of the House at one time) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[page&nbsp;165]</span>
to the clerical profession. The poet-bishop was the eldest son of John
King, Prebendary of St. Paul's and Chaplain to the Queen, himself a
verse-writer,
and after having been Dean of Christ Church, Bishop of London from
1611 to 1621. The son&mdash;if not without some nepotism yet with results which
fully justified it&mdash;became himself Prebendary of St. Paul's (as did a brother,
who was still younger, in the same year) when he was only four-and-twenty;
and successively received the archdeaconry of Colchester (1617); a canonry
at Christ Church (1624); and the deanery of Rochester (1639). He had
then the good and evil luck to be one of the large batch of Bishops made or
translated by Charles on the very eve of the Rebellion. He never sat in the
House of Lords before its suppression; and he had taken possession of his
see but a short time when he was rabbled out of his palace at Chichester and
plundered of his property, contrary to the terms of surrender of the City, by
Waller's soldiers. He was also ousted from the rich living of Petworth,
usually held <i>in commendam</i> with the (poor) bishopric of Chichester, by
that
particularly pestilent Puritan, Francis Cheynell. He seems to have passed
great part of the Interregnum with the Salters of Richkings, near Langley
in Bucks. (a house well famed for hospitality at different times and under
different owners and names<a id="footnotetagihk4" name="footnotetagihk4"></a><a href="#footnoteihk4"><sup>4</sup></a>), and at the Restoration he recovered his
preferments, Edmund Calamy <i>tertius</i> having the extraordinary impudence to
state that Cheynell was 'put out to make room for King'. And he held
them for nearly a decade longer, dying in 1669. He left children and
also grandchildren, one of whom, Elizabeth, seems to have married Isaac
Houblon, Pepys's 'handsome man'.</p>

<p>Despite King's persecutions by the Puritans he was accused of a leaning to
Puritanism, as his father had been before him,<a id="footnotetagihk5" name="footnotetagihk5"></a><a href="#footnoteihk5"><sup>5</sup></a> but seemingly without much
foundation. He appears to have been a sound Churchman, and a very good
man in every way, though with a slight tendency (not to be too harshly judged
by those who have lived in quieter times) to 'grizzle', as it is familiarly
called, over his tribulations. He was also what was termed at the time 'a
painful preacher' and a popular one. Pepys, it is true, did not like him when
he first heard him, and afterwards thought a sermon of his 'mean'. But
between these two he describes a third as 'good and eloquent'; and Samuel's
judgements on such matters, always unliterary, were also much conditioned
by circumstances, and by the curious remnant of Puritan leaven which
always remained in that very far from pure lump.</p>

<p>King's poems must, from various signs, have been much handed about
in manuscript; but how they came to be collected and published in 1657
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[page&nbsp;166]</span>
is quite unknown. They were at first attributed by some to his brother
Philip; and a reprint, or perhaps merely the remainder with a fresh title-page,
in 1700 actually attributed them to Ben Jonson, which was going far even
in a period which had seen Kirkman and was to see Curll.<a id="footnotetagihk6" name="footnotetagihk6"></a><a href="#footnoteihk6"><sup>6</sup></a> One or two
pieces besides <i>Sic Vita</i> are doubtful, and one or two more certainly not
his; but on the whole the collection seems to be fairly trustworthy, from
Dr. Hannah's comparison of it with MS. copies. And it rarely offers
<i>cruces</i> of interpretation.</p>

<p>As to the origin and general character of the pieces there is nothing
surprising about it either. King belonged to a time when, fortunately,
churchmanship, scholarship, and literature were almost inseparably connected;
and by accident or preference he seems, all his life, to have been
thrown or drawn into the society of men of letters. He was a friend if not
a 'son' of Ben Jonson; he was an intimate of Donne's, and one of the
recipients of the famous blood-stone seals; he was for more than forty years
(as he has himself recorded in a letter to Walton) a friend of 'honest Isaac'
[<i>sic</i>]. And if his middle days were politically unhappy, they, and still
more his earlier, were poetically fortunate. How, and in what degree, he
caught the wind as it blew has been partly indicated above: the text
should show the rest.<a id="footnotetagihk7" name="footnotetagihk7"></a><a href="#footnoteihk7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnoteihk1" name="footnoteihk1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagihk1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have suggested below that some slight scruples of pudibundity may have had their
influence; but if they had been serious the Archdeacon would hardly have promised
this rest.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteihk2" name="footnoteihk2"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagihk2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Until quite recently, and after this present edition had been long printed, one
appeared in America (Yale University Press, 1914) by Lawrence Mason, Ph.D.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteihk3" name="footnoteihk3"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagihk3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think this will justify the critic (whoever he was) whose sentence&mdash;'quaint
mediocrity and inappropriate metre'&mdash;offended Hannah's editorial chivalry as 'very
unjust'. Indeed, I should make it stronger and say 'irritating inadequacy alike in
metre and phrase'.</p>

But it has been doubted whether even this was a new <i>edition</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnoteihk7" name="footnoteihk7"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnotetagihk7"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The text of the following poems will be found, as far as Hannah's edition goes, to
differ not greatly from his; but it has been collated with the originals in print and MS.
by myself and, more carefully still, by Mr. Percy Simpson. The remaining poems
(including the fourth or 'King Charles' Elegy added in 1664, which Hannah did not
give) are adapted in the same way from direct photographic copies of the originals&mdash;collated
where necessary. The variants of <i>Sic Vita</i> which the Archdeacon collected are
of such interest and so characteristic of seventeenth-century poetry that it seemed
desirable to reproduce them.</p>

<p class="footnote">It may perhaps be added that the 1657 text is very carefully and well printed, requiring
so little modernization as practically to justify the standard adopted in this collection.
To modernize Chaucer or Chatterton has always seemed to me, though from slightly
different points of view, a grievous error or worse. But to show how close, when
scholarly writing met careful printing, the result even before the Restoration was to what
it would have been to-day, I have printed the opening poem exactly as it originally stood,
and have drawn attention in a note to the fewness of the differences. Because other
typographers, not deacons in their craft, and confronted perhaps with copy as bad as,
say, mine, <i>plus</i> the eccentric <i>ethelorthography</i> of the period, lavished italics and capitals
and superfluous <i>e</i>'s, and strappadoed the spelling, I cannot see why the eyes of a present-day
reader should be unnecessarily vexed.&mdash;Hannah's edition, as far as it goes, can
hardly be too well spoken of by any one who does not think that, in order to magnify
himself, it is necessary to belittle his predecessors. One cannot but regret that he did
not (as he might most easily have done, even in the single volume) complete his work.
As it is, I am deeply indebted to him. I have, however, restored the order of the
original, which he altered partly to get chronological sequence in the Elegies, &amp;c.,
and partly to make subject-heads for his groups&mdash;a proceeding which to me is rarely
satisfactory. But I have borrowed his useful datings of the individual pieces under
their titles.</p>

<h2>The Publishers to the Author.</h2>

<p class="ind2"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>It is the common fashion to make
some address to the Readers, but we
are bold to direct ours to you, who
will look on this publication with anger,
which others must welcome into the
world with joy.</p>

<p>The Lord Verulam comparing ingenious
authors to those who had
orchards ill neighboured, advised them
to publish their own labours, lest
others might steal the fruit: Had you
followed his example, or liked the
advice, we had not thus trespassed
against your consent, or been forced to
an apology, which cannot but imply a
fault committed. The best we can
say for ourselves is, that if we have
injured you, it is merely in your own
defence, preventing the present attempts
of others, who to their theft
would (by their false copies of these
Poems) have added violence, and
some way have wounded your reputation.</p>

<p>Having been long engaged on better
contemplations, you may, perhaps,
look down on these <i>Juvenilia</i> (most of
them the issues of your youthful
Muse) with some disdain; and yet
the courteous reader may tell you
with thanks, that they are not to be
despised, being far from abortive, nor
to be disowned, because they are both
modest and legitimate. And thus if
we have offered you a view of your
younger face, our hope is you will
behold it with an unwrinkled brow,
though we have presented the mirror
against your will.</p>

<p>We confess our design hath been
set forward by friends that honour you,
who, lest the ill publishing might disfigure
these things from whence you
never expected addition to your credit
(sundry times endeavoured and by
them defeated) furnished us with
some papers which they thought
authentic; we may not turn their
favour into an accusation, and therefore
give no intimation of their names,
but wholly take the blame of this hasty
and immethodical impression upon
ourselves, being persons at a distance,
who are fitter to bear it than those
who are nearer related. In hope of
your pardon we remain,</p>

<p class="center">Your most devoted servants,</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>The Double Rock</i>.] In this very typical metaphysicality of a good <i>second</i> water (see
note on Introduction), it will be observed that there is nothing archaic or irregular in
the spelling except the usual 'ne'<i>re</i>' for 'ne'<i>er</i>', the insertion of the three
superfluous <i>e</i>'s in lines 9, 10, and at most two or three gratuitous capitals with, if anybody
pleases, the omission of the apostrophe for the possessive in ll. 6, 9, 10, and 14.
'Chymistry' I should have kept, of course, even if I had altered these others.</p>

This and some others of the shorter poems which follow have been found by
Mr. Thorn-Drury in miscellanies of the period, not merely well-known ones like <i>Wits'
Recreations</i> (1641), but more obscure collections such as <i>Parnassus Biceps</i>, 1651, and
<i>Wits' Interpreter</i>, 1655. The usual variants occur; but they are seldom, if ever, <i>me

<p><i>A Blackmoor Maid</i>, and <i>Answer</i>.] I do not know whether the exact connexion
between these two poems and Cleveland's 'Fair Nymph scorning a Black Boy' (<i>v. sup.</i>,
<a href="#page42a">p. 42</a>) has ever been discussed. But if 'Mr. Hen. Rainolds' is Drayton's friend, the
verses printed above must have the priority, for nothing seems to be known of him
after 1632.</p>

<p>In Rawlinson MS. 1092, fol. 271, there are curious versions of these poems (the first
is ascribed to William Strode), inverting the parts 'A black boy in love with a fair
maid', and 'The fair maid's answer'.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>To a Friend upon Overbury's Wife, &amp;c.</i>] King seems to have been fond of giving this
popular production as a present, for the first of the three poems is certainly not
addressed to the recipient of the others, and it seems probable that 2 and 3 are also independent.
Hannah, without giving any reason, save the initials, suggests that 'A. R.'
was Lady Anne Rich (<i>v. inf.</i>).</p>

he loved her <i>The Exequy</i> and <i>The Anniverse</i> will tell in a few pages. But her initials
were A. B. (Anne Berkeley) not E. H. On the other hand, his sister <i>E</i>lizabeth married
Edward <i>H</i>olt, groom of the bedchamber to Charles I, who died in attendance on his
master (see Elegy on him, <i>inf.</i>). The verses might be fraternal, and are certainly

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Tell me no more, &amp;c.</i>] The heading of this famous thing as 'Sonnet' has, of course,
nothing surprising in it: in fact, the successive attachment of the title to five poems in
a batch here and to four more a little lower down&mdash;no one of which is a quatorzain, and
hardly two of which agree in form&mdash;is a capital example of the looseness with which
that title was used. MS. copies appear to have 'Sonnet' with <i>no</i> particular addition in
some cases.</p>

<p>On 'Tell me no more' itself see Introduction. The last two lines are, as they should
be, the finest part&mdash;with the fullness of contrasted vowel-sound in 'crowns', 'heart',
'e'er', and 'dies', and the emphasis of 'her'.</p>

<p><i>To his Friends of Christ Church</i>.] The occasion of this piece was one of those 'sorrowful
chances' which befall those who endeavour to please kings, whatever their name.
'The play' was Barton Holyday's <i>Technogamia</i>, and the 'misliking' (James actually
'offered' to go away twice, though, being a good-natured person, he was persuaded
to sit it out) is chronicled by Antony Wood under the author's name. It had been
acted with great applause in the House itself, and two of King's younger brothers
were among the performers. Also the 'frost' was made more unkind by the success
at Cambridge of Ruggles's <i>Ignoramus</i>. So King's spleen, if unwise, was not quite unmotived.
The date was August, 1621.</p>

<p>14 There is no probable reference to Malvolio, despite the association of 'cross-garter'd'
and 'Puritan'; but the tone of the passage enables one to some extent to
understand why the Puritan party conceived themselves to be deserted by King.</p>

but signed, in MS. Ashm. 38, fol. 51. I have not thought it necessary to collate this
version from a work described by good authorities as 'a bad MS.'. The piece itself,
however, with others of King's, may well have been in Dryden's mind when he composed
his own batch of Restoration welcome-poems to Charles II and Clarendon,
within three or four years of the publication of these. There is no plagiarism: Heaven
forbid that I should take part in plagiarism-hunting. But there is a sort of resemblance
in form and tone (especially in the use of 'You' and 'Your' as pivots), and (though
with great improvement) in versification.&mdash;The capital Y's here are almost complete in

<p><i>A Salutation, &amp;c.</i>] The <i>Sovereign</i>, <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, or <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (I am not
sure what name she bore during the Rebellion) is one of the famous <i>literary</i> ships of the
English Navy. She was built in 1637 at Woolwich by Phineas and Peter Pett out of
a whole year's ship-money; and if the means for raising her cost (£80,000) were
unpopular, a great deal of pride was taken in the ship herself. Thomas Heywood
wrote an account of her which has been frequently quoted. See, for instance,
Mr. David Hannay's <i>Short History of the Royal Navy</i>, i. 172, 173. She was of 1637
tons burthen; was pierced for 98 great guns with many smaller murdering-pieces
and chasers; and was most elaborately decorated, with carved stern, galleries, black
and gold angels, trophies and emblems of all sorts&mdash;besides a baker's dozen of allegorical,
mythological, and historical statues of personages from Cupid to King Edgar on horseback,
as figureheads and elsewhere. She fought all through the Dutch wars; escaped
the disgraceful disaster in the Medway; distinguished herself at La Hogue, where
a great part is assigned to her by some accounts in chasing Tourville's <i>Soleil Royal</i>
ashore; and was burnt by accident, not long after, at Chatham in 1696&mdash;her sixtieth
year.</p>

<p>11 The 'radiant brow' is of course the gilded figurehead group. There was
no actual 'Peace' among the allegories, but the Cupid, a 'child bridling a lion', might
perhaps stand for her.</p>

<p>18 'Tire' is of course 'tier': the <i>Sovereign</i> was a three-decker. Professor Skeat
approves the spelling, which occurs in Milton and elsewhere. But some would have
a special word 'tire', not for the <i>row</i> but the actual 'fire' or 'shooting' (<i>tir</i>) of the
guns&mdash;which would do well enough here.</p>

<p>19-22 King's own age would, after the event, have instanced this as an example of
Fate granting prayers to the letter yet evading them in the spirit. The <i>Sovereign</i> did
escape wind and wave, sand and rock, as well as the enemy, but only to perish
otherwise.</p>

<p><i>An Epitaph</i>.] This Dorset was the third earl, Richard. As a very young man he
married the famous Lady Anne Clifford, whose ill-luck in husbands may have been
partly caused, but must have been somewhat compensated, by her masterful temper.
Dorset, who died young, was both a libertine and a spendthrift; but King seems
to have thought well enough of him not only to write this epitaph, but to lend him, or
guarantee for him, a thousand pounds (quite £3,000 to-day), which he had at any
rate not got back thirty years afterwards. The present piece appears, with variants,
in Corbet's <i>Poems</i>, but King seems to have the better claim. Hannah gives a considerable
body of various readings from the Corbet version and one in the Ashmole MS. 38,
but it hardly seems worth while to burden the page-foot with them, for the epitaph is
mere 'common-form' and of no special interest.</p>

<p><i>The Exequy</i>.] This beautiful poem (which bore in Hannah's MS. the sub-title, itself

me no more', King's chief claim to poetic rank. It is not&mdash;he never is&mdash;splendid, or
strange, or soul-shaking; but for simplicity, sincerity, tenderness, and grace&mdash;nay, as
the time went, nature&mdash;it has, in its modest way, not many superiors.</p>

of 'earth', is perhaps better.</p>

<p><i>A Letter</i>.] I do not know any clue to the object of this epistle. King, like most
churchmen of distinction at the time, was on familiar terms with divers 'persons

<p>23 'Nod regardant' is good. It shows, with 'passant' just before that his own
reference to heraldry was still floating in King's mind.</p>

<p>54 Either of two of the numerous senses of 'blank' would come in here. One
is <i>tabula rasa</i>, the judgement being obscured by no prepossession; the other 'bull's-eye'
or 'target'.</p>

evidently addressed to the same person. The recipient of the <i>Letter</i> might be of either
sex, for 'mistress' in l. 66 (<i>v. sup.</i>) is not quite decisive in the context. This 'precious
Friend' is definitely feminine. Nineteenth&mdash;I do not know about twentieth&mdash;century
man would have been a little uncomfortable about receiving from a lady a gold chain
with a grouped diamond pendant, welcome as the enclosed 'lock' might be. But, as
Scott and others have long ago remarked, there was none of this false pride in
the seventeenth, and you might even take money from the beloved. The combination
of death's heads, equally of the time, is more of all time.</p>

<h4><i>That it is best for a Young Maid to marry an Old Man.</i></h4>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Fair one, why cannot you an old man love?</p>
<p>He may as useful, and more constant prove.</p>
<p>Experience shows you that maturer years</p>
<p>Are a security against those fears</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[page&nbsp;205]</span>
<p>Youth will expose you to; whose wild desire</p>
<p>As it is hot, so 'tis as rash as fire.</p>
<p>Mark how the blaze extinct in ashes lies,</p>
<p>Leaving no brand nor embers when it dies</p>
<p>Which might the flame renew: thus soon consumes</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Youth's wand'ring heat, and vanishes in fumes.</p>
<p>When age's riper love unapt to stray</p>
<p>Through loose and giddy change of objects, may</p>
<p>In your warm bosom like a cinder lie,</p>
<p>Quick'ned and kindled by your sparkling eye.</p>
<p>'Tis not deni'd, there are extremes in both</p>
<p>Which may the fancy move to like or loathe:</p>
<p>Yet of the two you better shall endure</p>
<p>To marry with the cramp than calenture.</p>
<p>Who would in wisdom choose the Torrid Zone</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Therein to settle a plantation?</p>
<p>Merchants can tell you, those hot climes were made</p>
<p>But at the longest for a three years' trade:</p>
<p>And though the Indies cast the sweeter smell,</p>
<p>Yet health and plenty do more Northward dwell;</p>
<p>For where the raging sunbeams burn the earth,</p>
<p>Her scorched mantle withers into dearth;</p>
<p>Yet when that drought becomes the harvest's curse,</p>
<p>Snow doth the tender corn most kindly nurse:</p>
<p>Why now then woo you not some snowy head</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>To take you in mere pity to his bed?</p>
<p>I doubt the harder task were to persuade</p>
<p>Him to love you: for if what I have said</p>
<p>In virgins as in vegetals holds true,</p>
<p>He'll prove the better nurse to cherish you.</p>
<p>Some men we know renown'd for wisdom grown</p>
<p>By old records and antique medals shown;</p>
<p>Why ought not women then be held most wise</p>
<p>Who can produce living antiquities?</p>
<p>Besides if care of that main happiness</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Your sex triumphs in, doth your thoughts possess,</p>
<p>I mean your beauty from decay to keep;</p>
<p>No wash nor mask is like an old man's sleep.</p>
<p>Young wives need never to be sunburnt fear,</p>
<p>Who their old husbands for umbrellas wear:</p>
<p>How russet looks an orchard on the hill</p>
<p>To one that 's water'd by some neighb'ring drill?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[page&nbsp;206]</span>
<p>Are not the floated meadows ever seen</p>
<p>To flourish soonest, and hold longest green?</p>
<p>You may be sure no moist'ning lacks that bride,</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Who lies with winter thawing by her side.</p>
<p>She should be fruitful too as fields that join</p>
<p>Unto the melting waste of Apennine.</p>
<p>Whilst the cold morning-drops bedew the rose,</p>
<p>It doth nor leaf, nor smell, nor colour lose;</p>
<p>Then doubt not, Sweet! Age hath supplies of wet</p>
<p>To keep You like that flower in water set.</p>
<p>Dripping catarrhs and fontinells are things</p>
<p>Will make You think You grew betwixt two springs.</p>
<p>And should You not think so, You scarce allow</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>The force or merit of Your marriage-vow;</p>
<p>Where maids a new creed learn, and must from thence</p>
<p>Believe against their own or others' sense.</p>
<p>Else love will nothing differ from neglect,</p>
<p>Which turns not to a virtue each defect.</p>
<p>I'll say no more but this; you women make</p>
<p>Your children's reck'ning by the almanac.</p>
<p>I like it well, so you contented are,</p>
<p>To choose their fathers by that kalendar.</p>
<p>Turn then, old <i>Erra Pater</i>, and there see</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>According to life's posture and degree,</p>
<p>What age or what complexion is most fit</p>
<p>To make an English maid happy by it;</p>
<p>And You shall find, if You will choose a man,</p>
<p>Set justly for Your own meridian,</p>
<p>Though You perhaps let <i>One and Twenty</i> woo,</p>
<p>Your elevation is for <i>Fifty-Two</i>.</p>

<p><i>Paradox. That it is best, &amp;c.</i>] After Hannah's omission of <i>The Acquittance</i> it is not
surprising that he did not give this or the next&mdash;though a greater excess of prudishness
appears in the exclusion of <i>The Change</i>, and one begins to think that something more
than accident, indolence, or business prevented the appearance of the promised second
volume. But if there is some nastiness there is very little naughtiness in them.</p>

<p>33 Some have thought 'vegetal', which was not uncommon in the seventeenth
century, a better form than 'vegetable', though this latter has prevailed. It is the
French word, and though in Latin there is no 'vegetalis' and there is 'vegetabilis', yet
this latter has quite a different sense.</p>

<p>44 Orig. has 'umbrell<i>ae</i>s', not 'umbrell<i>o</i>s' (or -oes), which seems to be the older form.</p>

<p>46 It would be pardonable to suppose 'drill' an error for 'rill'. But the word is
unquestionably used in the sense by Sandys and Jeremy Taylor, and seems to be the
same as the slightly older 'trill' in the sense of 'trickle'.</p>

<h4><i>That Fruition destroys Love.</i></h4>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Love is our Reason's Paradox, which still</p>
<p>Against the judgement doth maintain the will:</p>
<p>And governs by such arbitrary laws,</p>
<p>It only makes the act our liking's cause:</p>
<p>We have no brave revenge, but to forgo</p>
<p>Our full desires, and starve the tyrant so.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">They whom the rising blood tempts not to taste,</p>
<p>Preserve a stock of love can never waste;</p>
<p>When easy people who their wish enjoy,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Like prodigals at once their wealth destroy.</p>
<p>Adam till now had stay'd in Paradise</p>
<p>Had his desires been bounded by his eyes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[page&nbsp;207]</span>
<p>When he did more than look, that made th' offence,</p>
<p>And forfeited his state of innocence.</p>
<p>Fruition therefore is the bane t' undo</p>
<p>Both our affection and the subject too.</p>
<p>'Tis Love into worse language to translate,</p>
<p>And make it into Lust degenerate:</p>
<p>'Tis to dethrone, and thrust it from the heart,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>To seat it grossly in the sensual part.</p>
<p>Seek for the star that 's shot upon the ground,</p>
<p>And nought but a dim jelly there is found.</p>
<p>Thus foul and dark our female stars appear,</p>
<p>If fall'n or loos'ned once from Virtue's Sphere.</p>
<p>Glow-worms shine only look'd on, and let lie,</p>
<p>But handled crawl into deformity:</p>
<p>So beauty is no longer fair and bright,</p>
<p>Than whilst unstained by the appetite:</p>
<p>And then it withers like a blasted flower,</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>Some pois'nous worm or spider hath crept o'er.</p>
<p>Pygmalion's dotage on the carved stone,</p>
<p>Shows amorists their strong illusion.</p>
<p>Whilst he to gaze and court it was content,</p>
<p>He serv'd as priest at Beauty's monument:</p>
<p>But when by looser fires t' embraces led,</p>
<p>It prov'd a cold hard statue in his bed.</p>
<p>Irregular affects, like madmen's dreams</p>
<p>Presented by false lights and broken beams,</p>
<p>So long content us, as no near address</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Shows the weak sense our painted happiness.</p>
<p>But when those pleasing shadows us forsake,</p>
<p>Or of the substance we a trial make,</p>
<p>Like him, deluded by the fancy's mock,</p>
<p>We shipwrack 'gainst an alabaster rock.</p>
<p>What though thy mistress far from marble be?</p>
<p>Her softness will transform and harden thee.</p>
<p>Lust is a snake, and Guilt the Gorgon's head,</p>
<p>Which Conscience turns to stone, and Joys to lead.</p>
<p class="i2">Turtles themselves will blush, if put to name</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>The act, whereby they quench their am'rous flame.</p>
<p>Who then that 's wise or virtuous, would not fear</p>
<p>To catch at pleasures which forbidden were,</p>
<p>When those which we count lawful, cannot be</p>
<p>Requir'd without some loss of modesty?</p>
<p>Ev'n in the marriage-bed, where soft delights</p>
<p>Are customary and authoriz'd rites;</p>

<p>But toleration of Incontinence?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[page&nbsp;208]</span>
<p>For properly you cannot call that Love</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Which does not from the soul, but humour move.</p>
<p>Thus they who worship'd Pan or Isis' Shrine,</p>
<p>By the fair front judg'd all within divine:</p>
<p>Though ent'ring, found 'twas but a goat or cow</p>
<p>To which before their ignorance did bow.</p>
<p>Such temples and such goddesses are these</p>
<p>Which foolish lovers and admirers please:</p>
<p>Who if they chance within the shrine to pry,</p>
<p>Find that a beast they thought a Deity.</p>
<p>Nor makes it only our opinion less</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Of what we lik'd before, and now possess;</p>
<p>But robs the fuel, and corrupts the spice</p>
<p>Which sweetens and inflames Love's sacrifice,</p>
<p>After fruition once, what is Desire</p>
<p>But ashes kept warm by a dying fire?</p>
<p>This is (if any) the Philosopher's Stone</p>
<p>Which still miscarries at projection.</p>
<p>For when the Heat <i>ad Octo</i> intermits,</p>
<p>It poorly takes us like Third Ague fits,</p>
<p>Or must on embers as dull drugs infuse,</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Which we for med'cine not for pleasure use.</p>
<p class="i2">Since lovers' joys then leave so sick a taste,</p>
<p>And soon as relish'd by the sense are past;</p>
<p>They are but riddles sure, lost if possest,</p>
<p>And therefore only in reversion best.</p>
<p>For bate them expectation and delay,</p>
<p>You take the most delightful scenes away.</p>
<p>These two such rule within the fancy keep,</p>
<p>As banquets apprehended in our sleep;</p>
<p>After which pleasing trance next morn we wake</p>
<p><span class="right1">90</span>Empty and angry at the night's mistake.</p>
<p>Give me long dreams and visions of content,</p>
<p>Rather than pleasures in a minute spent.</p>
<p>And since I know before, the shedding rose</p>
<p>In that same instant doth her sweetness lose,</p>
<p>Upon the virgin-stock still let her dwell</p>
<p>For me, to feast my longings with her smell.</p>
<p>Those are but counterfeits of joy at best,</p>
<p>Which languish soon as brought unto the test.</p>
<p>Nor can I hold it worth his pains who tries</p>
<p><span class="right1">100</span>To in that harvest which by reaping dies.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Resolve me now what spirit hath delight,</p>
<p>If by full feed you kill the appetite?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[page&nbsp;209]</span>
<p>Since nat'rally the blood, when tam'd or sated,</p>

<p><i>Paradox. That Fruition, &amp;c.</i>] Put less tersely but perhaps better by Dryden's
most original heroine, Doralice, in <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>, 'The only way to keep us true
to each other is never to enjoy'. The notion is old enough, and several other seventeenth-century
poets have treated it.</p>

<p>22 Nobody has ever assigned a (to me, at least) plausible reason for this universal
fancy of the seventeenth century about the jellification of shooting-stars. It is curious,
but not inexplicable, that Browne does not touch it.</p>

<p>31 King has very coolly turned the Pygmalion story upside down to suit his thesis.</p>

the expression is vigorous. The nearest parallel I know to it is Crabbe's 'Natural

the case is more unusual. The Spanish motto (rather dog-Spanish in original) means:
'The wise man changes consciously: the fool [or, rather, madman] perseveres.'</p>

<p><i>An Elegy upon Mrs. Kirk, &amp;c.</i>] This and the following were not in Hannah's MS. He,
perhaps not quite accurately, regards this as King's <i>only</i> indulgence in what he also
regarded as 'the frigid and artificial style popular among his contemporaries'. But he
thought it better than the companion piece in Heath's <i>Clarastella</i> (<i>v. inf.</i>). From this
latter we learn that Mrs. Kirk was one of the numerous victims of 'shooting the bridge'.
The piece is frigid enough certainly, but rather from want of 'conceit' than because
of it. (Mr. Thorn-Drury has reminded me of Glapthorne's two elegies on the same
subject. They form the last contents of the 1874 reprint and give more detail in
their title, 'On the noble and much to be lamented Mrs. Anne Kirk, wife to Mr. Geo.
Kirk, Gent. of the Robes and of his Majesty's Bed Chamber, who was unfortunately
drowned passing London Bridge, July 6. 1641'.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Edward Holt</i>.] Holt was King's brother-in-law, having married his sister Elizabeth
(<i>v. sup.</i>, <a href="#page173">p. 173</a>). He died at Oxford in 1643 while attending the King as Groom of the
Bedchamber, and was buried in the Cathedral. His father, who outlived him, was
a Baronet, and is again abused by King in his will as having been 'implacable'; but
the Bishop apparently thought better of his nephew Sir Robert, who was a stout
Royalist and churchman both before and after the Restoration. Walton dedicated his
<i>Life of Donne</i> to this Sir Robert Holt. His much-abused grandfather had at any rate
set the example of loyalty, and is said to have been plundered or extortioned by Parliamentary
'contributions' or 'compositions' to the amount of about £20,000.</p>

<p><i>Ben. Jonson</i>.] In orig., as so often, 'Jo<i>h</i>nson'. A contribution to <i>Jonsonus Virbius</i>,
which, printed nearly twenty years before these <i>Poems</i>, has one slight variant = 'that'
for 'who' in l. 7.</p>

<p>5 scythe] Orig. 'sithe', which some great ones (including even the other Johnson)
will have to be the proper spelling, and which is certainly usual in Middle English. But
'scythe' is consecrated by the only Sainte Ampoule of orthography&mdash;usage; 'sithe' also
means 'a path' and 'a sigh', and may be mistaken for 'since', while 'scythe' is unmistakable.
And for my part, if I may not have 'scythe' I stickle for 'sigðe'&mdash;the
undoubted original.</p>

<p>38  It was a little dangerous, in Ben's lifetime, to praise others in company with him.
But King here corroborates Drummond's <i>Conversations</i>, in which Ben is made to speak
well of Chapman on several occasions, and (more particularly) to declare his <i>Iliad</i>, or
part of it, 'well done'.</p>

<p>42 It is rather curious that Drummond (in one of those <i>Marginalia</i> in which he
relieves his feelings somewhat subacidly) declares that his robustious guest 'neither
understood French nor Italian'.</p>

taken away from the evil to come. The present poem appears to me (though, of
course, the high-strung character of the mourning seems to have been both general
and sincere) to be much more 'frigid and artificial' than the <i>Mrs. Anne Kirk</i>. Hannah
gives several variants, not merely from his usual MS. but from Malone 21. I have
taken those which seem to have some point.</p>

<p>Like a cold fatal sweat which ushers death,</p>
<p>My thoughts hang on me, and my lab'ring breath</p>
<p>Stopp'd up with sighs, my fancy, big with woes,</p>
<p>Feels two twinn'd mountains struggle in her throes,&mdash;</p>
<p>Of boundless sorrow one,&mdash;t' other of sin;&mdash;</p>
<p>For less let no one rate it, to begin</p>
<p>Where honour ends.&mdash;In great Gustavus' flame,</p>
<p>That style burnt out, and wasted to a name,</p>
<p>Does barely live with us. As when the stuff</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>That fed it, fails, the taper turns to snuff,</p>
<p>With this poor snuff, this airy shadow, we</p>
<p>Of Fame and Honour must contented be;</p>
<p>Since from the vain grasp of our wishes fled</p>
<p>Their glorious substance is, now He is dead.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Speak it again, and louder, louder yet;</p>
<p>Else, whilst we hear the sound, we shall forget</p>
<p>What it delivers. Let hoarse rumour cry,</p>
<p>Till she so many echoes multiply,</p>
<p>Those may like num'rous witnesses confute</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Our unbelieving souls, that would dispute</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[page&nbsp;221]</span>
<p>And doubt this truth for ever. This one way</p>
<p>Is left our incredulity to sway;</p>
<p>To waken our deaf sense, and make our ears</p>
<p>As open and dilated as our fears;</p>
<p>That we may feel the blow, and feeling, grieve,</p>
<p>At what we would not fain, but must believe.</p>
<p>And in that horrid faith, behold the world</p>
<p>From her proud height of expectation hurl'd,</p>
<p>Stooping with him, as if she strove to have</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>No lower centre now than Sweden's grave.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">O could not all thy purchas'd victories</p>
<p>Like to thy fame thy flesh immortalize?</p>
<p>Were not thy virtue nor thy valour charms</p>
<p>To guard thy body from those outward harms</p>
<p>Which could not reach thy soul? could not thy spirit</p>
<p>Lend somewhat which thy frailty might inherit</p>
<p>From thy diviner part, that Death, nor Hate,</p>
<p>Nor Envy's bullets e'er could penetrate?</p>
<p>Could not thy early trophies in stern fight</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Torn from the Dane, the Pole, the Moscovite?</p>
<p>Which were thy triumph's seeds, as pledges sown,</p>
<p>That when thy honour's harvest was ripe grown,</p>
<p>With full-summ'd wing thou falcon-like wouldst fly,</p>
<p>And cuff the Eagle in the German sky:</p>
<p>Forcing his iron beak and feathers feel</p>
<p>They were not proof 'gainst thy victorious steel.</p>
<p>Could not all these protect thee? or prevail</p>
<p>To fright that coward Death, who oft grew pale</p>
<p>To look thee and thy battles in the face?</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Alas! they could not: Destiny gives place</p>
<p>To none; nor is it seen that princes' lives</p>
<p>Can saved be by their prerogatives.</p>
<p>No more was thine; who, clos'd in thy cold lead,</p>
<p>Dost from thyself a mournful lecture read</p>
<p>Of man's short-dated glory: learn, you kings,</p>
<p>You are, like him, but penetrable things;</p>
<p>Though you from demi-gods derive your birth</p>
<p>You are at best but honourable earth:</p>
<p>And howe'er sifted from that coarser bran,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Which does compound and knead the common man,</p>
<p>Nothing's immortal, or from earth refin'd</p>
<p>About you, but your office and your mind.</p>
<p>Here then break your false glasses, which present</p>
<p>You greater than your Maker ever meant:</p>
<p>Make truth your mirror now, since you find all</p>
<p>That flatter you, confuted by his fall.</p>

<p>Most just and regular proportion.</p>
<p>Look how the circles drawn by compass meet</p>
<p>Indivisibly joined, head to feet,</p>
<p>And by continued points which them unite,</p>
<p>Grow at once circular and infinite:</p>
<p>So did thy Fate and Honour now contend</p>
<p>To match thy brave beginning with thy end.</p>
<p>Therefore thou hadst, instead of passing bells,</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>The drums' and cannons' thunder for thy knells;</p>
<p>And in the field thou didst triumphing die,</p>
<p>Closing thy eyelids with a victory:</p>
<p>That so by thousands who there lost their breath,</p>
<p>King-like thou might'st be waited on in death.</p>
<p>Lived Plutarch now, and would of Caesar tell,</p>
<p>He could make none but Thee his parallel;</p>
<p>Whose tide of glory, swelling to the brim,</p>
<p><span class="right1">90</span>Needs borrow no addition from him.</p>
<p>When did great Julius, in any clime,</p>
<p>Achieve so much, and in so small a time?</p>
<p>Or if he did, yet shalt Thou in that land</p>
<p>Single, for him, and unexampled stand.</p>
<p>When o'er the Germans first his Eagle towr'd,</p>
<p>What saw the legions which on them he pour'd?</p>
<p>But massy bodies, made their swords to try,</p>
<p>Subjects, not for his fight, but slavery.</p>
<p>In that so vast expanded piece of ground</p>
<p><span class="right1">100</span>(Now Sweden's theatre and tomb), he found</p>
<p>Nothing worth Caesar's valour or his fear,</p>
<p>No conqu'ring army, nor a Tilly there,</p>
<p>Whose strength, nor wiles, nor practice in the war</p>
<p>Might the fierce torrent of thy triumphs bar,</p>
<p>But that thy winged sword twice made him yield,</p>
<p>Both from his trenches beat, and from the field.</p>

<p><i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>.] This piece had been previously printed in the <i>Swedish Intelligencer</i>,
1633, with other elegies on the subject, one of which (in Malone MS. 21) is
also ascribed to King, but without any other evidence, and (as Hannah seems to
be right in thinking) very improbably. He gives some variants, only two of which seem
to me important enough to reproduce. There are also versions in Rawlinson Poetic
MS. 26, fol. 51, and 160, fol. 39.</p>

<p>4 throes] Orig. 'thro<i>w</i>s'.</p>

<p>6-7 Hannah in his note, though in his text he had followed <i>1657</i>, as above, prefers the
reading of the <i>Intelligencer</i>&mdash;a full-stop at 'it', and 'To begin', which is to a certain extent
supported by a capitalized 'To' in his MS., though there is not a full-stop. He has two
notes on the subject, and for a moment I was perplexed. But I feel certain that the
<i>1657</i> text is right. Hannah's parallel from King's prose, 'I begin there where all must
end', is specious, but not convincing. On the other hand, 'To begin, &amp;c.' is wanted
to complete 'for less' and to explain 'sin'. Honour, as the next sentence further tells
us, perished with Gustavus, and it is a solecism to attempt to continue it in verse. This
is, in the Archdeacon's words elsewhere, 'frigid and artificial' enough; but it is also
sufficiently 'metaphysical'.</p>

<p>10 Orig. has full-stop at 'snuff', but this (which Hannah keeps and does not comment
on) leaves nothing to complete 'as'.</p>

<p>11 airy] For the 'ayerie' of edition and Malone MS., the <i>Intelligencer</i>, and Rawlinson
MS. 160 have 'fiery'&mdash;I think, in the context, better.</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Sir, I must ever own myself to be</p>
<p>Possess'd with human curiosity</p>
<p>Of seeing all that might the sense invite</p>
<p>By those two baits of profit and delight:</p>
<p>And since I had the wit to understand</p>
<p>The terms of native or of foreign land;</p>
<p>I have had strong and oft desires to tread</p>
<p>Some of those voyages which I have read.</p>
<p>Yet still so fruitless have my wishes prov'd,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>That from my Country's smoke I never mov'd:</p>
<p>Nor ever had the fortune (though design'd)</p>
<p>To satisfy the wand'rings of my mind.</p>
<p>Therefore at last I did with some content,</p>
<p>Beguile myself in time, which others spent;</p>
<p>Whose art to provinces small lines allots,</p>
<p>And represents large kingdoms but in spots.</p>
<p>Thus by Ortelius and Mercator's aid</p>
<p>Through most of the discover'd world I stray'd.</p>
<p>I could with ease double the Southern Cape,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>And in my passage Afric's wonders take:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[page&nbsp;224]</span>
<p>Then with a speed proportion'd to the scale</p>
<p>Northward again, as high as Zemla sail.</p>
<p>Oft hath the travel of my eye outrun</p>
<p>(Though I sat still) the journey of the Sun:</p>
<p>Yet made an end, ere his declining beams</p>
<p>Did nightly quench themselves in Thetis' streams.</p>
<p>Oft have I gone through Egypt in a day,</p>
<p>Not hinder'd by the droughts of Lybia;</p>
<p>In which, for lack of water, tides of sand</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>By a dry deluge overflow the land.</p>
<p>There I the Pyramids and Cairo see,</p>
<p>Still famous for the wars of Tomombee,</p>
<p>And its own greatness; whose immured sense</p>
<p>Takes forty miles in the circumference.</p>
<p>Then without guide, or stronger caravan</p>
<p>Which might secure the wild Arabian,</p>
<p>Back through the scorched deserts pass, to seek</p>
<p>Once the world's Lord, now the beslaved Greek,</p>

<p>How he achiev'd, and kept, and by what arts</p>
<p>He did concentre those divided parts;</p>
<p>And how he holds that monstrous bulk in awe,</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>By settled rules of tyranny, not Law:</p>

<p>Made up of Arab, Saracen, and Jew,</p>
<p>The world's disturber, faithless Mahomet</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Did by impostures an opinion get:</p>
<p>O'er whom he first usurps as Prince, and than</p>
<p>As prophet does obtrude his Alcoran.</p>
<p>Next, how fierce Ottoman his claim made good</p>
<p>From that unblest religion, by blood;</p>
<p>Whilst he the Eastern kingdoms did deface,</p>
<p>To make their ruin his proud Empire's base.</p>
<p>Then like a comet blazing in the skies,</p>
<p>How death-portending Amurath did rise,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[page&nbsp;225]</span>

<p><span class="right1">70</span>Upon the fatal plains of Servia;</p>
<p>And farther still his sanguine tresses spread,</p>
<p>Till Croya life and conquests limited.</p>
<p>Lastly, how Mahomet thence styl'd the Great,</p>
<p>Made Constantine's his own Imperial seat;</p>
<p>After that he in one victorious bond</p>
<p>Two Empires grasp'd, of Greece and Trebizond.</p>

<p><i>Mr. George Sandys</i>.] These verses appeared as commendatory to Sandys' well-known
<i>Paraphrase upon the Divine Psalms</i>, 1648. Sandys was not only a friend of King (as
of all his group), but, according to l. 14 of this piece, a relation: the exact connexion,
however, was unknown to Hannah and Hooper, and is to me. Indeed, l. 18 might be
taken to mean that we were not to look further for 'extraction' than to the fact that
they were both sons of bishops. Hannah saw this, but drew the inference somewhat
too positively.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy Simpson has found the following variants in Sandys' own book:</p>

<p class="ind">25 might] would.</p>

<p class="ind">27 straight vow'd] strait-vow'd.</p>

<p class="ind">King may have retouched the piece.</p>

<p>23 Orig. note: [Sir Edwin Sandys' survey of Religion in the West] More properly
entitled <i>Europae Speculum</i> (1559).</p>

<p>53 seq. In the original there are side-notes: 'Job', 'Ecclesiastes', 'The Act
of Parliament for Public Thanksgiving on the fifth of November, set to a tune by
H. Dod a tradesman of London, at the end of his Psalms, which stole from the Press
Anno Domini 1620'; 'Hymns', 'Lamentations', 'Psalms', referring to other Paraphrases
of Sandys on the various books named, and (in the third place) on certain
Songs selected from other parts of the Bible. The unfortunate 'H. Dod a tradesman'
may have had his Manes refreshed by a notice in the <i>D.N.B.</i></p>

<p>70 It was too early for King to recognize, as has been done since, the reason of the
'perfect harmony' he relished as a fact in Sandys. That poet was one of the earliest
after Fairfax, and probably before Beaumont or Waller, to master (though not always
to practise) the stopped antithetic couplet which was conquering, and to conquer,
public favour.</p>

<p>71 It were much to be desired (though Hannah did not think so) that King
had allowed his wishes to be satisfied by Sandys' performance, without attempting
competition.</p>

<p>79 The reference is, of course, to the universally heard of, but perhaps by extremely
few read, 'Sternhold and Hopkins'. The actual terms of King's criticism are not very
happy, but nobody then knew, or easily could know, much about literary history. It
was a fifteenth- rather than a sixteenth-century fault 'hardly to distinguish <i>verse</i>
and <i>rhyme</i>'. Where Sternhold and Hopkins&mdash;in common with much greater men, from
Wyatt to Gascoigne&mdash;sometimes went wrong, was in their inability to attain anything
but a 'butterwoman's rank to market'&mdash;a sing-song and soulless uniformity of
cadence, and (a sin more specially their own) in the hopeless dullness and drabness
of their diction.</p>

<p><i>The Woes of Esay</i>.]  It may seem strange that a man of poetical velleities, with
the magnificent range of choice open to him in the Book of Isaiah, should choose these
'Woes' for verse-paraphrase. But the fact is interesting as combining with others,
which have been pointed out here and there already, to show that King, at one time of
his life, <i>had</i> leanings to that Puritan-popular temper which, from the days of Langland
downwards, had shown itself in England. The couplet verse has some vigour.</p>

<p>84 The original apostrophation (kept by Hannah) of 'every' is 'e'ry'&mdash;interesting
to compare with the common forms of 'e're' for 'ever' and 'ne're' for 'never'.
<i>N. E. D.</i> traces it to the fifteenth century, and notes an eighteenth-century extension
to 'e'ery'.</p>

<h3><i>An Essay on Death and a Prison.</i><a name="page232a" id="page232a"></a></h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A prison is in all things like a grave,</p>
<p>Where we no better privileges have</p>
<p>Than dead men, nor so good. The soul once fled</p>
<p>Lives freer now, than when she was cloistered</p>
<p>In walls of flesh; and though she organs want</p>
<p>To act her swift designs, yet all will grant</p>
<p>Her faculties more clear, now separate,</p>
<p>Than if the same conjunction, which of late</p>
<p>Did marry her to earth, had stood in force,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Uncapable of death, or of divorce:</p>
<p>But an imprison'd mind, though living, dies,</p>
<p>And at one time feels two captivities;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[page&nbsp;233]</span>
<p>A narrow dungeon which her body holds,</p>
<p>But narrower body which herself enfolds.</p>
<p>Whilst I in prison lie, nothing is free,</p>
<p>Nothing enlarg'd, but thought and misery;</p>
<p>Though every chink be stopp'd, the doors close barr'd,</p>
<p>Despite of walls and locks, through every ward</p>
<p>These have their issues forth; may take the air,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Though not for health, but only to compare</p>
<p>How wretched those men are who freedom want,</p>
<p>By such as never suffer'd a restraint.</p>
<p>In which unquiet travel could I find</p>
<p>Aught that might settle my distemper'd mind,</p>
<p>Or of some comfort make discovery,</p>
<p>It were a voyage well employ'd: but I,</p>
<p>Like our raw travellers that cross the seas</p>
<p>To fetch home fashions, or some worse disease,</p>
<p>Instead of quiet, a new torture bring</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>Home t' afflict me, malice and murmuring.</p>
<p>What is't I envy not? no dog nor fly</p>
<p>But my desires prefer, and wish were I;</p>
<p>For they are free, or, if they were like me,</p>
<p>They had no sense to know calamity.</p>
<p>But in the grave no sparks of envy live,</p>
<p>No hot comparisons that causes give</p>
<p>Of quarrel, or that our affections move</p>
<p>Any condition, save their own, to love.</p>
<p>There are no objects there but shades and night,</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>And yet that darkness better than the light.</p>
<p>There lives a silent harmony; no jar</p>
<p>Or discord can that sweet soft consort mar.</p>
<p>The grave's deaf ear is clos'd against all noise</p>
<p>Save that which rocks must hear, the angel's voice:</p>
<p>Whose trump shall wake the world, and raise up men</p>
<p>Who in earth's bosom slept, bed-rid till then.</p>
<p>What man then would, who on death's pillow slumbers,</p>
<p>Be re-inspired with life, though golden numbers</p>
<p>Of bliss were pour'd into his breast; though he</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>Were sure in change to gain a monarchy?</p>
<p>A monarch's glorious state compar'd with his,</p>
<p>Less safe, less free, less firm, less quiet is.</p>
<p>For ne'er was any Prince advanc'd so high</p>
<p>That he was out of reach of misery:</p>
<p>Never did story yet a law report</p>
<p>To banish fate or sorrow from his Court;</p>
<p>Where ere he moves, by land, or through the main,</p>
<p>These go along, sworn members of his train.</p>
<p>But he whom the kind earth hath entertain'd,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Hath in her womb a sanctuary gain'd,</p>
<p>Whose charter and protection arm him so,</p>
<p>That he is privileg'd from future woe.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[page&nbsp;234]</span>
<p>The coffin 's a safe harbour, where he rides</p>
<p>Land-bound, below cross winds, or churlish tides.</p>
<p>For grief, sprung up with life, was man's half-brother,</p>
<p>Fed by the taste, brought forth by sin, the mother.</p>
<p>And since the first seduction of the wife,</p>
<p>God did decree to grief a lease for life;</p>
<p>Which patent in full force continue must,</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Till man that disobey'd revert to dust.</p>
<p>So that life's sorrows, ratifi'd by God,</p>
<p>Cannot expire, or find their period,</p>
<p>Until the soul and body disunite,</p>
<p>And by two diff'rent ways from each take flight.</p>
<p>But they dissolved once, our woes disband,</p>
<p>Th' assurance cancell'd by one fatal hand;</p>
<p>Soon as the passing bell proclaims me dead,</p>
<p>My sorrows sink with me, lie buried</p>
<p>In the same heap of dust, the self-same urn</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Doth them and me alike to nothing turn.</p>
<p>If then of these I might election make</p>
<p>Whether I would refuse, and whether take,</p>
<p>Rather than like a sullen anchorite</p>
<p>I would live cas'd in stone, and learn to write</p>
<p>A <i>Prisoner's story</i>, which might steal some tears</p>
<p>From the sad eyes of him that reads or hears;</p>
<p>Give me a peaceful death, and let me meet</p>
<p>My freedom seal'd up in my winding sheet.</p>
<p>Death is the pledge of rest, and with one bail</p>
<p><span class="right1">90</span>Two prisons quits, the Body and the Jail.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>An Essay</i>.] This piece stands to some work of Donne's much as others of King's do
to the lyrics of the greater poet. The couplets are more enjambed than in <i>The Woes of
Esay</i>, and the metaphysicality is of the satiric kind. It should not be needful, but may
be well, to say that King had no actual experience of prisons. On the other side of
the matter the piece might, but by no means need, belong to the series connected with
his wife's death.</p>

<p><i>Sic Vita</i>.] On this famous piece see Introduction. Only the first form is attributed to
King and appears in his <i>Poems</i>; but it also appears not merely in the singular higgledy-piggledy
called the poems of Francis Beaumont, 1653, but in the earlier and better edition
of 1640. Simon Wastell was a schoolmaster who had been at Queen's College, Oxford;
and who in 1629 appended these sets of verses to a book then entitled <i>Microbiblion</i>. The
first is claimed by Quarles, who also wrote another in the form. William Browne's
version was not published till 1815, and the authors of the two from the Malone MS. are
unknown. The group is probably the palmary example in English of that coterie-and
school-verse which distinguished the seventeenth century. The King-Beaumont form is
certainly the best and probably the original. (It will be observed that X is <i>palinodic</i> to
the others. It is, <i>with</i> IX, attributed as a single piece to Strode and entitled 'On
Death and Resurrection' in MS. Malone 16, fol. 35, and Dobell's <i>Poetical Works of
W. Strode</i>).</p>

<p>This, like an act of envy, not of grief,</p>

<p><i>An Elegy upon my best friend</i>.] King's 'best friend' (or, as a MS. gives it, 'worthiest')
was Katharine Stanhope, daughter of John Lord Stanhope of Harrington. Her husband,
Robert Cholmondeley, successively created an Irish Viscount, an English Baron (his
surname serving as title in each case), and Earl of Leinster, died very shortly after her
and before the Restoration. There is a MS. sermon on her death attributed to King,
but doubted by Hannah. The poem itself, unlike the next but like the three which
follow that, appears printed in the 1664 issue. And it is, on the principles of this
collection, not unimportant to notice that in these later printed pieces the irrational
prodigality of capitals which, as has been noted, is absent from <i>1657</i>, reappears. There
could be no stronger evidence that these things have nothing to do with the author, and
are not worth reproducing.</p>

as illustrating the utter unreason of the practice.</p>

<p><i>On the Earl of Essex</i>.] This and the next two may be called King's chief, if not his
only, political poems: that they were kept back till after the Restoration is not
surprising. Of Essex&mdash;one of the most unfortunate of men, the son of an unlucky
father, the husband of one of the worst of women, and of another not much better,
a half-hearted rebel, a soldier not less brave than blundering&mdash;not much is to be said
here. King had some interest in the first and universally known divorce (the second,
much less notorious, was from Elizabeth Paulet), for his father had been uncourtly and
honest enough to oppose it strongly.</p>

<p>10 This rather vigorous line was to be prophetic as well as true at the time, for when,
after the Restoration, the title of Essex was revived it was for the Capels, who still hold
it, not for any Devereux. The vigour just referred to is by no means absent from the
whole poem, and in an ante-Drydenian piece is really remarkable.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Elegy on Sir Charles Lucas, &amp;c.</i>] This, King's longest poem (except the <i>King Charles</i>),
shows, like the preceding, a vigour which might have made him a very formidable
political satirist. If he has not Cleveland's wit he is free from Cleveland's abuse of it.
The subject is again a well-known one. No impartial authority denies that the execution
of Lucas and Lisle was one of the worst blots on that side of the record of the
Rebellion, and perhaps the only unforgivable act of Fairfax. Whether he was
actuated, as the Royalists generally believed, by a mean personal spite, or allowed
himself to be the tool of Ireton, matters uncommonly little; and his own 'Vindication'
contains statements demonstrably false. However, as usual in revolutions, the curse
came home, and the Colchester 'Septemberings' (as they would actually have been
had the New Style prevailed in England) were undoubtedly as much instrumental as
anything, next to the execution of the King himself, in turning the national sentiment
against the perpetrators. The <i>bracketed</i> notes that follow are, as usual, original.</p>

<p>31 [Sir George Lisle at Newbury charged in his shirt, and routed them.] This was
the <i>second</i> battle of Newbury, October 27, 1644: he was knighted at Oxford, December
21, 1645.</p>

<p>49 friend] [Patroclus.]</p>

<p>60 Mercy] Fairfax in his own 'Vindication' admits the 'snare'. 'Delivering upon
Mercy is to be understood that some are to suffer, the rest to go free.' In other words,
the garrison might take 'mercy' to mean 'quarter', but Fairfax took it to mean
'discretion'.</p>

<p>64 Orig. 'President', as often printed, though of course no scholar like King would
deliberately write it.</p>

<p>66 [Famagosta, defended most valiantly by Signior Bragadino in the time of
Selimus II, was upon honourable terms surrendered to Mustapha the Bashaw, who,
observing no conditions, at his tent murdered the principal commanders, invited thither
under show of love, and flayed Bragadine alive.] This siege of Famagosta in 1571,
which came just before, and may be said to have been revenged by, Lepanto, greatly
affected the mind of Christendom, and is duly chronicled in Knolles, the chief English
historical writer of King's day. It is therefore hardly necessary to suppose, with
Hannah, that the note was abridged from George Sandys' <i>Travels</i>, though King and
Sandys were certainly friends.</p>

<p>82, 85 I would have left the capitals for the 'Yous' in these lines, as I have already
done in other places, because they not improperly further emphasize that emphatic use
of the pronoun in different parts of the line which Dryden afterwards perfected. But
unfortunately they are not uniformly used, or even in the majority of cases&mdash;which
shows how utterly haphazard and irrational this capitalization was.</p>

<p>105 [The Swedes hired anno 1644, to invade the King of Denmark, provided to
assist his nephew, the King of England.]</p>

<p>115 Hopkins] Hannah only knew for a certainty that the scoundrel Matthew was
'swum' for a wizard, and had to put a 'probably' as to his being executed. There
seems to be no doubt (see <i>D.N.B.</i>) that the great and glorious 'Herb Pantagruelion'
had its own, and that Hopkins was hanged in 1647, before the date of this poem. But
in that distracted time King, like his editor, may easily have been unaware of it.</p>

<p>117 An early literary use of 'cad' for assistant or understrapper.</p>

<p>142 Instead of 'for' Hannah, who very seldom meddled with his text, suggested
'from'. The temptation is obvious, but I think 'for' is possible, and therefore preferable
as <i>lectio difficilior</i>.</p>

<p>160 Military Justice] [See the letter sent to Edward Earl of Manchester, Speaker of
the House of Peers, <i>pro tempore</i>, from T. Fairfax, dated August 29, 1648, at Hieth.]
According to Royalist accounts there were, even in Parliament, speakers bold enough
and impartial enough to object to this letter, and to give voice to the common belief that
the execution was either an act of private vengeance, or a deliberate affront to the King,
or a device to make the pending negotiations with him impossible. It must be remembered
that it was three months before the 'Purge' had deprived the Commons of
the last remnant of independence or representative quality.</p>

<p>170 petty tyrannies] [Wat Tyler and his complices' design was to take away
the King and chief men, and to erect petty tyrannies to themselves in every shire.
And already one Littistar, a dyer, had taken upon him in Norfolk the name of King of
Commons, and Robert Westborn in Suffolk, Richard II, anno 1381. <i>Speed.</i>] This note
from Speed is not exactly quoted and Hannah corrected it, but the variations are of no
importance.</p>

<p>176 There is no doubt about the selling of prisoners as convict-slaves to the West
Indies (if not, as Rigby proposed, to Algiers) by the Roundheads after the second
Civil War. Unluckily James II&mdash;born in this and other cases to be the curse of
English Royalism&mdash;took the reproach away from the other side by authorizing the
practice after Sedgmoor.</p>

<p>179 The particular bearer of this name of evil repute in Parliamentary history was
Alexander Rigby (1594-1650). He had a brother, Joseph, whose politics were as bad
as his own, but who survived the Restoration, and seems to have had a touch of the
'crank' in him. I have not yet come across his <i>Drunkard's Prospective</i> (1656), but it
should be agreeable.</p>

<p>183 The savagery of the two-to-one victors at Naseby&mdash;especially towards the hapless
so-called 'Irishwomen' camp followers&mdash;is beyond question, but it does not seem
proved that there was much selling of prisoners then. As for St. Fagan's in the second
Civil War the case is different, and justifies the following note in the original: 'At
St. Fagan's in Glamorganshire, near Cardiff, the Welsh unarmed were taken in very
great numbers, and sold for twelve pence apiece to certain merchants, who bought
them for slaves to their plantations.'</p>

<p>188 aspers] A Turkish coin of the smallest value: the 120th part of a piastre or
dollar.</p>

<p>201 murd'rous crew] [Grimes, now a Captain, formerly a tinker at St. Albans, with
his own hand killed four of the prisoners, being not able for faintness to go on with the
rest, of which number Lieutenant Woodward was one. Likewise at Thame, and
at Whateley ( = Wheatley), some others were killed.] This story is backed up by
not a few similar ones in different accounts of the time. And indeed, as King very
cogently goes on to argue, your tinker-captain is capable of anything.</p>

<p>222 It was Sir Horace Vere (1565-1635), afterwards Lord Vere of Tilbury, under
whom Fairfax served, and whose daughter Anne he married.</p>

<p>231 Whalley (spelt, as often with the name, Whaley in printed original) is cleared
by others, though he is said by them as by King to have been present and to have had
some private grudge against Lisle. Lucas had not only thrown Fairfax's troops into
disorder at Marston Moor but is said by some to have actually wounded him in the face.
He had also held Berkeley Castle against Rans- or Ra<i>in</i>sborough till the outworks were
taken, and the guns turned from them on the Castle itself. Rainsborough, with
Whalley and Ireton, was actually present at the execution&mdash;which as a duty could
hardly be incumbent on all three, and with which they were often reproached; and as
a matter of course Rainsborough's death shortly afterwards was counted as a 'judgement'.
His father had been an officer in the Navy, and the son commanded both by
sea and land.</p>

<p> 284 Algol] A star of great but varying brightness, the name of which&mdash;'The <i>ghoul</i>'&mdash;and
its position in the head of Medusa in the constellation Perseus, explains the text.</p>

<p> 311 long and doubtful] Fairfax, to enhance his exploit, called it 'four months close
siege'. It was actually not quite eleven weeks, but the place yielded to nothing but
starvation.</p>

<p>Restoring Him to his lost Crown again.</p>
<p class="i2">But You had other plots, your busy hate</p>
<p>Plied all advantage on His fallen state,</p>

<p>Till on pretence of safety Cromwell's wile</p>
<p><span class="right1">390</span>Had juggl'd Him into the Fatal Isle,</p>

<p>To act without and quite against the King.</p>
<p>Yet when that cloud remov'd, and the clear light</p>

<p class="i2">Thus like two smoking firebrands, You and They</p>
<p>Have in this smother chok'd the Kingdom's day:</p>
<p>And as you rais'd them first, must share the guilt,</p>
<p>With all the blood in those distractions spilt.</p>
<p>For though with Sampson's foxes backward turn'd</p>

<p>And kept Him pris'ner to secure His health;</p>
<p>So in revenge of your dissembled spite,</p>
<p>In this last wrong you did Him greatest right,</p>
<p>And (cross to all You meant) by plucking down</p>
<p>Lifted Him up to His Eternal Crown.</p>

<p><i>An Elegy upon King Charles the First</i>.] I have thought it desirable to give this Elegy
though Hannah did not, and though I scarcely myself think it to be King's, first
because it is very little known (it was strange even to Professor Firth when I asked
him about it); secondly, because the 1664 issue or reissue seems worth completing;
but thirdly, and principally, because it is well worth giving. It seems to me, in fact,
rather too good in a certain way to be King's. He could write, as we have seen, fairly
vigorous couplets of a kind rather later than this date; but I do not know where he
keeps up such continuous and effective 'slogging' as here. The Colchester piece, which
is the natural parallel, is distinctly inferior in that respect. There are, moreover, in
the piece some things which I suspect King would not, as well as could not, have
written, and which perhaps influenced Hannah in not giving it. The close and effective
Biblical parallels are not quite in the Bishop's way in verse, and the clear vigorous
summary of the whole rebellion&mdash;dates and facts in margin&mdash;is like nothing else of his
that I know. But&mdash;his or not his&mdash;it is found with his undoubted work; it is good;
and so it shall be given.</p>

<p>But the reader must not suppose that it has never appeared except in the 1664 King
or before that. While reading for the present edition I had noticed an entry of a very
similar title in Hazlitt, and on looking the book up in the British Museum I found it, as
I expected, to be identical in all important respects, putting aside some minor variants
and a shorter title, with 1664. The original (in black border at least an inch deep) adds:
'Persecuted by two implacable factions, Imprisoned by the one and murthered by the
other, January 30th, 1648.' The final prose clause is the same, and I noticed no various
readings, except merest 'literals'&mdash;an occasional capital for lower case, '-or' for '-our',
and the like&mdash;which it did not seem necessary to collate or report exactly.</p>

<i>Title</i>] As usual, 'Charls' in original.]

<p>14 Zechariah xii. 11 compared with 2 Kings xxiii. 29 and 2 Chronicles xxxv. 22-4.</p>

<p>27 This line is slightly ambiguous. At first one takes 'Judges' as referring to the
regicide tribunal&mdash;and of course not merely the dignity but the unanswerable logic of
Charles's attitude is admitted. But our elegist would hardly admit that the King
moved in the sphere of his rebellious subjects, so that it may be a reference to the
legally constituted bench of earlier years&mdash;'<i>his</i> Judges' in another sense.</p>

<p>40 See 2 Kings xx, 2 Chronicles xxxii, and Isaiah xxxix.</p>

<p>45 A little prosaic. Old St. Paul's was being constantly tinkered: indeed, as is
well known from Evelyn's <i>Diary</i>, there were plans for very extensive restoration just
before the Fire.</p>

<p>48 Orig. 'losses', which at the time would stand equally well for singular and plural
genitive.</p>

<p>58 Orig. 'sacrifise', to get a complete ear-rhyme.</p>

<p>61 This apostrophe to the 'cursed mountebanks of State' is uncommonly vigorous,
and much straighter 'hitting from the shoulder' than King usually manages.</p>

<p>100 Orig. 'husband', without 's, and possibly intended.</p>

<p>124 perspective] As commonly = 'telescope'.</p>

<p>138 Watkins I know not; Pennington we have seen in Cleveland; Venn (1586-1650)
was John Venn, wool-merchant, M.P., active rebel, and regicide.</p>

<p>142 This (original) may read, 'Your mouths, laid on, maintain the cry', which seems
most probable; or, 'Your mouth's [<i>i.e.</i> is] laid on "Maintain the cry".'</p>

<p>146 1 Samuel xxiii 24. Jeshimon seems to have escaped Alexander the Concordance-smith.</p>

<p>155 foil] The word in this sense had puzzled me; but the readers of the Clarendon
Press put me literally on it by reference to <i>N.E.D.</i> It means the 'scent' or 'track'
of a hunted animal and occurs in the first sense in Turbervile, and elsewhere, as well as
(figuratively used) in as late and well-known a place as <i>Tom Jones</i>.</p>

<p>199 'Moil'&mdash;or rather, more commonly, 'moyle'&mdash;is very common for 'mule' in
Elizabethan drama, and is said to be still dialectic, especially in Devon and Cornwall.</p>

<p>223 'Goal' would seem here to be used as = 'jakes', though it has been suggested
that the common sense of 'jail' will do.</p>

<p>226 Orig. 'Coaps'.</p>

<p>238 'probation' must here = '<i>ap</i>probation'.</p>

<p>246 Orig. 'Idol Bel<i>l</i>', which may puzzle for a moment. Of course the Dragon's
companion and Nebo's is meant. The poet seems indeed rather to have mixed up the
monster and the false god.</p>

<p>250 Here again there seems to be a slight confusion between Pantagruel and his
glorious father.</p>

<p>265-6 Another uncommonly vigorous couplet.</p>

<p>312 The writer either intended to continue the set of participles or forgot that he had
begun it. But if 'For Presbyterian ... supremacy' be thrown into parenthesis the
anacoluthon will be mended&mdash;after a fashion.</p>

<p>373-4 Good again; and with a fore-echo of Dryden's 'Shimei' rhythm and swashing
blow.</p>

<p>392 lieger-hangman] 'Hangman resident', house-hangman'.</p>

<p>403 Orig. 'Armies', with the usual choice between singular and plural genitive or
(here) nominative plural.</p>

<p>415 I think it well to keep the form 'Treator'.</p>

<p>430 Pointed, if slightly burlesque.</p>

<p>432 hand-wolves] A dog trained and on the leash was said to be 'in hand'.</p>

<p>438 Philisti<i>a</i>] The letter here is slightly 'smashed' and the word might be
'Philistins' or 'Philistia's'. It looks more like the former, but the latter is better,
and is said to be clear in Mr. Thorn-Drury's copies.</p>

<p>444 platform] This is interesting.</p>

The following group of poems has been printed by Mr. Mason, the first as authentic,
the others as doubtful. He points out that <i>The Complaint</i> and <i>On his Shadow</i> are
autograph, and written on the same sheet of paper as the lines <i>Upon the Untimely
Death of J. K.</i> The text here printed has been supplied by Mr. Percy Simpson from
the original MSS., and the few textual notes are his. In view of the uncertainty of
the bulk of the matter I [G. S.] have not thought it worth while to add any annotation
of the more general kind. In addition, Mr. Mason prints a translation of a Latin elegy
on Dr. Spenser, President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; the Latin text of this in
Rawlinson MS. D. 912, fol. 305 verso, is in King's autograph, but the translation
is not, and moreover it is so tinkered and changed as to suggest the efforts of a far
from facile, if very conscientious, copyist. This has not been printed, and only the
first of the following poems can with certainty be ascribed to King.</p>

1630 to the son of a second marriage: l. 40 refers to a living wife, who could not be
the lady of <i>The Exequy</i>. King's authorship must therefore be regarded as doubtful.</p>

however, been quoted as King's in more than one anthology; and it would probably

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THOMAS FLATMAN.</h2>

<p>Flatman has been condoled with on his name by Mr. Bullen, one of the
few persons who have done him some justice in recent years.<a id="footnotetagitf1" name="footnotetagitf1"></a><a href="#footnoteitf1"><sup>1</sup></a> I should
rather myself, for reasons which will be given presently, condole with him
on his date. His father was probably Robert Flatman of Mendham,
Norfolk, and it is supposed that the poet was born in London. The date
of his birth, recorded here for the first time, was February 21, 1635, about
5.29 in the morning. So his horoscope, preserved by Ashmole,<a id="footnotetagitf2" name="footnotetagitf2"></a><a href="#footnoteitf2"><sup>2</sup></a> informs
us. When he was elected at Winchester on Michaelmas Day, 1648, he
was stated to be 'eleven years old'&mdash;a slight miscalculation. He himself
in <i>The Retirement</i>, written in 1665, correctly speaks of his 'thirty years'.
He actually entered Winchester in September, 1649. He was transferred
in the usual (when uninterrupted) course to New College, Oxford; he was
admitted as a probationer on September 11, 1654, but seems not to have
matriculated till July 25, 1655; he became Fellow in 1656.<a id="footnotetagitf3" name="footnotetagitf3"></a><a href="#footnoteitf3"><sup>3</sup></a> There is no
academic record, it would seem, of his ever having taken his degree,
though he is spoken of as 'A.B. of Oxford' when, by the King's Letters,
he was made M.A. of St. Catherine Hall, Cambridge, in 1666. He went
from Oxford to the Inner Temple, in 1655, and was called to the Bar on
May 11, 1662. Oldys has a half-satiric reference to his pleading.<a id="footnotetagitf4" name="footnotetagitf4"></a><a href="#footnoteitf4"><sup>4</sup></a> He
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April, 1668. In 1672
he married, his wife being favourably spoken of, and gossip&mdash;inevitable
whether well founded or not&mdash;records that his 'Bachelor's Song' (<i>v. inf.</i>)
was sung under his windows on the occasion by 'merry friends'. And he died
in London on December 8, 1688. Beyond these meagre details, and a
statement that he had property at Diss (the cure of Skelton and the home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>
of Maria Jolly), we know little about him directly or by external evidence.
By that of his poems he must have been a friend of good men&mdash;Walton,
Cotton, Edward Browne<a id="footnotetagitf5" name="footnotetagitf5"></a><a href="#footnoteitf5"><sup>5</sup></a> (Sir Thomas's son), Faithorne the engraver,
Oldham, and others. His miniature portraits are well spoken of;&mdash;one
is in possession of the Duke of Buccleuch, seven are in the South
Kensington Museum. That, however, which illustrates his <i>Poems</i> is
from a painting by John Hayls, whom Pepys's Diary has made known
to a wider circle than students of the History of English Painting.</p>

<p>Flatman was evidently a tolerable scholar; and his Latinity, of which
several specimens will be found here, does no discredit to the Winchester
and the New College of the time. When he began English verse-writing
does not seem to be known, but it must have been pretty early. He does
not appear to have hurried his Muse; but collected his poems first in 1674,
issuing augmented editions, to the number of four in all, up to a time shortly
before his death. Of these, the third (1682) and the fourth (1686) have
a claim to be regarded as authoritative and are the basis of the present
text. The 1682 edition, 'With Additions and Amendments', is better
printed, and the 1686&mdash;which makes a modest attempt to outbid it 'With
many Additions and Amendments'&mdash;is valuable for the supplementary
poems.<a id="footnotetagitf6" name="footnotetagitf6"></a><a href="#footnoteitf6"><sup>6</sup></a> His Pindaric epicedes on public men&mdash;Ossory, Rupert, the
King, &amp;c.&mdash;for the most part appeared separately in folio; and in the
earlier days of my preparation of this collection I gave myself a good deal
of trouble in looking them up. Except the elegy on Ormond (1688)
they were reprinted in these two editions. The last (1686) edition of the
<i>Poems</i>, after some search, was procured for me. It seems to be much rarer
than the third of 1682, which I have long possessed, and is not in the
Bodleian. Additional poems, not included in the texts of 1682 and 1686,
are added as a supplement. Three of these are taken from a transcript in
Professor Firth's collection of an autograph MS. of Flatman which is now
in America; the title is 'Miscellanies by Tho. Flatman, ex Interiori
Templo Londini. Sic imperantibus fatis. Nov. 9, 1661, 13° Caroli 2<sup>di</sup>.'
This contains in all twenty-three of the poems which have been collated
for this reprint. An interesting feature of this manuscript is that it dates
a number of the poems. Besides his poems, some pamphlets and
Almanacks<a id="footnotetagitf7" name="footnotetagitf7"></a><a href="#footnoteitf7"><sup>7</sup></a> have been attributed to him on extremely doubtful evidence,
or none at all. Except among his friends, it does not seem even in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
own time to have been the fashion to think much of his verse; and
a triplet of Rochester's, dismissing him as an imitator of Cowley,
and a bad one, is usually quoted.<a id="footnotetagitf8" name="footnotetagitf8"></a><a href="#footnoteitf8"><sup>8</sup></a> Flatman's Pindarics are certainly his
weakest poems. But Rochester, for all his wit and wits, was, though
an acute, a very ill-natured critic; we know that he thought Cowley
himself out of date and (as his representatives in kind, though not
in gift, would say to-day) 'early Caroline'. Besides, to dismiss a Pindaric
poet of the Restoration as an imitator, and a bad imitator, of Cowley is too
obvious to be of much importance. I should certainly admit that the
minor Pindaric&mdash;of which I have, for my sins or as part of them, probably
read as much as any one living&mdash;is one of the most dismal departments of
English verse. But Flatman's is by no means exceptionally bad, and is at
its best better than that of Oldham, or of Otway, or of Swift&mdash;men with
whom he cannot compare as a man of letters generally. Let us come
closer to him and to his work.</p>

<p>Hayls may not have been a great painter; but he certainly seems to have
had the knack of putting character in his portraits. Neither that of Pepys
nor that of his wife is without it: and that of Flatman has a great deal.<a id="footnotetagitf9" name="footnotetagitf9"></a><a href="#footnoteitf9"><sup>9</sup></a>
It is what would be called, I suppose, by most superficial judges an 'ugly'
face&mdash;with a broad <i>retroussé</i> nose, lips of the kind sometimes called
'sensual',
and a heavy (something of a double) chin. But the forehead is high, the
mouth smallish, and above all there are a pair of somewhat melancholy
eyes which entirely rescue it from any charge of vulgarity, though it is not
exactly refined. It certainly suggests what is called in stock phrase an
'artistic temperament': and it may not be too fanciful to see in it the
kind of artistic temperament which aims higher than it can hit, begins
what it is unable to finish, and never forgets the yew even among the
roses. This complexion is, of course, in a way reflected in the very titles of
the few things of Flatman known<a id="footnotetagitf10" name="footnotetagitf10"></a><a href="#footnoteitf10"><sup>10</sup></a> to the few people who do know him&mdash;'Death',
'A Thought of Death', 'A Dooms-day Thought', 'Nudus
Redibo', &amp;c. But it is almost everywhere; and there is no affectation or
<i>sensiblerie</i> about it. Flatman is not, as Longfellow, picturesquely and
perhaps Carlylesquely, remarked of Matthiessen and Salis, 'a gentleman who
walks through life with a fine white cambric handkerchief pressed to his
eyes'. He can write battle-songs and love-songs and festive <i>gaillardises</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>
naturally enough. But the other vein is also natural, and perhaps more
so. The funeral panegyric Odes which make a considerable feature of his
works were, of course, almost part of the routine business of a professional
poet in those times of patronage: one of his regular sources of revenue, in
fives or tens or hundreds of guineas, according to his rank on Parnassus and
the rank and liberality of his subject in Church or State or City. But
Flatman at his best suffuses them with a grave interest in Death itself&mdash;a
touch now of Lucretius (who seems to have been a favourite of his),
now of the Preacher&mdash;which is not in the least conventional. In this
curious Second Caroline period of faint survivals of the Renaissance and
complete abandonment of its traditions, Flatman's heritage appears to have
been this sense of Death. A poet might have a worse portion.</p>

<p>In powers of expression he was not equally well apanaged: and it
was unlucky for him that he fell in with the special period of popularity
of that difficult and dangerous thing the Pindaric, and had enough of the
older taste in him to attempt the short metaphysical lyric: 'The Resolve',
'The Fatigue', 'The Indifferent'. For the first he carried guns hardly
heavy enough; for the second his lyrical craft was hardly sufficiently swift
and handy to catch every puff of spiritual wind. Yet it is mildly astonishing
to find how often he comes near to success, and how near that
approach sometimes is. How many poets have tried to put the thought
of the first line of the first poem in the complete edition:</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>No more!&mdash;Alas! that bitter word, <i>No more!</i></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and how many have put it more simply and passionately? The 'Morning
Hymn' and 'Evening Anthem' have rather strangely missed (owing no
doubt to that superficial connexion with Bishop Ken's which is noticed below)
association with hundreds and thousands of very often inferior divine poems
that have found home in collections. 'The Resolve' begins quite admirably,
and only wanted a little more pains on the poet's part to go on as well.
'Love's Bravo' and 'The Expectation' and 'Fading Beauty' and 'The
Slight' are very far indeed from being contemptible. The two
<i>gaillardises</i>,
the 'Bachelor' and the 'Cats', want very little to make them quite capital;
and 'The Whim' is in the same case. 'The Advice' actually deserves
that adjective, and not a few others will be found pointed out in the notes;
while even his Pindarics (at least the earlier ones, for those written after
Rochester's death more fully justify his censure than those he can have
read) have fine lines and even fine passages.</p>

<p>It is no doubt rather unfortunate that Flatman should have left us so
many Horatian translations. For the one thing needful&mdash;except in a very
few pieces where Horace outgoes himself in massive splendour, and so can
be outgone further by more of this, as in Dryden's magnificent version of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>
<i>Tyrrhena regum</i>&mdash;the one thing needful in translating Horace is something
of his well-known and 'curious' urbane elegance. And this was the very
quality which perhaps no Restoration poet&mdash;certainly not Flatman&mdash;could
give. The 'dash of vulgarity'<a id="footnotetagitf11" name="footnotetagitf11"></a><a href="#footnoteitf11"><sup>11</sup></a> which Mr. Bullen has too truly stigmatized
affects nearly all of them except when transported by passion (which is
nowhere in Horace); or fighting hard in a mood of satiric controversy
which is quite different from his pococurantism; or using a massive
rhetoric which is equally absent from him. The consequence is that what
Flatman gives us is not Horace at all; and is not good Flatman. The
'Canidia' pieces, as one would expect, are about the best, and they are
not very good.</p>

<p>I own, however, and I am duly prepared to take the consequences of the
confession, that Flatman appeals to me, though in a different way, almost as
much as any other of the constituents of this volume, though certainly not
so much as some of those of the other two. He had the pure misfortune&mdash;as
the sternest critic must acknowledge it to have been&mdash;of being born too
late for one period and too early for another. He could not give to his
most serious things the 'brave translunary' exaltations and excursions
which came naturally to the men of a time just before his, and he could
not correct this want by the order and the sense, the neatness and the
finish, which were born with the next generation. 'Death' and 'A
Thought of Death' and the other things mentioned unfairly but inevitably
remind us that we have left Donne and Crashaw, Vaughan, and even
Herbert, behind us. 'The Mistake' and 'The Whim' and many others
remind us that we have not come to Prior. Yet others&mdash;which it were
cruel to particularize and which he that reads will easily find for
himself&mdash;display
a lack of the purely lyrical power which, among his own contemporaries,
Rochester and Sedley and Aphra Behn, not to mention others,
possessed. Nor had he that gift of recognizing the eclipse of the Moon and
utilizing the opportunities of the Earth, which has made Dryden, to competent
and catholic tastes, all but one of the greatest of English poets. But
still he was a 'child of the Moon' herself; and he has the benefits which
she never withholds from her children, though they may be accompanied
by a disastrous influence. He was no doubt a minor poet in a time when
minor poetry was exposed to special disadvantages. But with far less wit
he was more of a poet than Cleveland; with far less art he was perhaps
as much of a poet as Stanley; and I am not even sure that, with 'weight
for age' in the due sense, he was so very much less of a poet than King.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
And if those who think but little of these others as poets deem this scanty
praise let us go further and say that he <i>is</i> a poet&mdash;imperfect,
disappointing
as well as disappointed, only half aneled with the sacred unction and
houselled with the divine food&mdash;but a poet. Which if any denies he may
be 'an excellent person'&mdash;as Praed or Praed's Medora so finally puts it&mdash;but
he does not know much, if indeed he knows anything, about poetry.<a id="footnotetagitf12" name="footnotetagitf12"></a><a href="#footnoteitf12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Browne's diary (March, 1663-4) contains repeated mention of 'Mr. Flatman,

of the connexion of the Flatmans with Norfolk.</p>

The publisher was Benjamin Tooke, whom Flatman in a letter of November 3,
1675, recommended to Sancroft if he wished to publish his Fifth of November sermon
before the House of Commons (Tanner MS. xlii, fol. 181, in Bodley).</p>

Four letters of Flatman are published in <i>Familiar Letters of Love, Gallantry, And
Several Occasions, By the Wits of the last and present Age</i>, 1718, vol. i, pp. 249-54.
One of these is a letter to an unnamed patron, sending his own portrait for the patron's

Flatman, however, is much less 'coarse' than most of his contemporaries. Putting
a very few pieces aside (not themselves very shocking) he might almost challenge my
Lord Roscommon for those 'unspotted bays' which his own supposed debtor Pope
assigned, and of which we are all so tired.</p>

<h2>To the Reader.</h2>

<p><i>When I was prevail'd upon to make
a Fourth Publication of these</i> Poems
<i>with a great many Additions</i>, <i>it was
told me</i>, <i>That without a</i> Preface <i>the
Book would be unfashionable; Universal
Custom had made it a Debt</i>, <i>and
in this Age the</i> Bill of Fare <i>was as
necessary as the</i> Entertainment. <i>To
be Civil therefore</i>, <i>and to Comply with
Expectation</i>, <i>instead of an elaborate
Harangue in Commendation of the Art
in general</i>, <i>or what, and what Qualifications
go to the making up of a</i>
Poet <i>in particular</i>, <i>and without such
artificial Imbellishments as use to be
the Ornament of Prefaces</i>, <i>as</i> Sayings
of Philosophers, Ends of Verses, Greek,
Latin, Hungarian, French, Welch, <i>or</i>
Italian, <i>Be it known unto the Reader</i>,
<i>That in my poor Opinion</i> Poetry <i>has
a very near Resemblance to the modern
Experiment of the</i> Ambling-Saddle;
<i>It's a good Invention for smoothing the</i>
Trott of Prose; <i>That's the Mechanical
use of it. But Physically it gives
present Ease to the</i> Pains <i>of the</i> Mind,
<i>contracted by violent Surfeit of either

to the Measures observ'd by me</i>, <i>I always

so in Versifying</i>) <i>I had then opportunity
to fill it up with a</i> Metaphor <i>little to

to prescribe how a</i> Muse <i>ought to be
Courted</i>, <i>and I want leisure to borrow
from some Treatises I have seen</i>, <i>which
look like so many</i> Academies <i>of</i> Complements

known a man</i>, <i>who when he was about
to write would screw his face into more
disguises than</i> Scaramuccio, <i>or a</i>
Quaker <i>at a Meeting when his Turn
came to mount; his breast heav'd</i>, <i>his
hair stood on end</i>, <i>his eyes star'd</i>, <i>and
the whole man was disorder'd; and
truly when he had done, any body at

Whim took him in the head to Prophesie,</i>)

<i>I have had the happiness to hear of a

Poetical, <i>he was a</i> Walking Poem,
<i>and his way was this; finding that
the fall of the Leaf was already
upon him</i>, <i>and prudently foreseeing that
in the Winter of his old Age he might
possibly want Fodder</i>, <i>he carry'd always
about him one of</i> Raimund Lully's

custom was to digest all that he had

This was his</i> Arsenal, <i>his inexhaustible</i>
Magazine; <i>so that upon occasion he had
no more to do</i>, <i>than to give a snap</i>, <i>or
two to his Nails; a rub or two upon
the sutures of his Head</i>, <i>to turn over
his</i> Hint-Book, <i>and the Matter was at
hand</i>, <i>his business</i> (<i>after that piece of</i>
Legerdemain) <i>was only</i> Tacking, <i>and</i>
Tagging: <i>I never saw but One of this
Author's Compositions</i>, <i>and really It
troubled me</i>, <i>because It put me in mind,
how much time I had mispent in Coffee-Houses</i>,

that Hector their</i> Muses: <i>Some that
Diet their</i> Pegasus, <i>give him his Heats
and Ayrings for the Course; Others
that endeavour to slop up his broken
wind with Medicinal Ale and Bisquet;
But these for the most part are men of</i>
Industry; <i>Rhiming is their proper
Business</i>, <i>they are fain to labour
hard</i>, <i>and use much Artifice for a poor
Livelihood</i>, <i>I wish 'em good Trading.
I profess I never had design to be incorporated
into the Society; my utmost
End was merely for Diversion of my
self and a few Friends whom I very
well love; and if the question should
be ask'd why these Productions are expos'd</i>,
<i>I may truly say</i>, <i>I could not help
it; One unlucky Copy</i>, <i>like a Bell-weather</i>,

should be the first Copy of the Book</i>, <i>but
therein I had the greatest advantage
given me that any Noble Subject could
afford. And so much for</i> Preface <i>and</i>
Poetry, <i>till some very powerful Star
shall over-rule my present Resolution.</i></p>

<h3>On the Excellent Poems of my most Worthy<br />
Friend, Mr. Thomas Flatman.</h3>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>You happy issue of a happy wit,</p>
<p>As ever yet in charming numbers writ,</p>
<p>Welcome into the light, and may we be</p>
<p>Worthy so happy a posterity.</p>
<p>We long have wish'd for something excellent;</p>
<p>But ne'er till now knew rightly what it meant:</p>
<p>For though we have been gratified, 'tis true,</p>
<p>From several hands with things both fine and new,</p>
<p>The wits must pardon me, if I profess,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>That till this time the over-teeming press</p>
<p>Ne'er set out Poesy in so true a dress:</p>
<p>Nor is it all, to have a share of wit,</p>
<p>There must be judgement too to manage it;</p>
<p>For Fancy's like a rough, but ready horse,</p>
<p>Whose mouth is govern'd more by skill than force;</p>
<p>Wherein (my friend) you do a maistry own,</p>
<p>If not particular to you alone;</p>
<p>Yet such at least as to all eyes declares</p>
<p>Your Pegasus the best performs his airs.</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Your Muse can humour all her subjects so,</p>
<p>That as we read we do both feel and know;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span></p>
<p>And the most firm impenetrable breast</p>
<p>With the same passion that you write's possest.</p>
<p>Your lines are rules, which who shall well observe</p>
<p>Shall even in their errors praise deserve:</p>
<p>The boiling youth, whose blood is all on fire,</p>
<p>Push'd on by vanity, and hot desire,</p>
<p>May learn such conduct here, men may approve</p>
<p>And not excuse, but even applaud his love.</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>Ovid, who made an art of what to all</p>
<p>Is in itself but too too natural,</p>
<p>Had he but read your verse, might then have seen</p>
<p>The style of which his precepts should have been,</p>
<p>And (which it seems he knew not) learnt from thence</p>
<p>To reconcile frailty with innocence.</p>
<p>The love <i>you</i> write virgins and boys may read,</p>
<p>And never be debauch'd but better bred;</p>
<p>For without love, beauty would bear no price,</p>
<p>And dullness, than desire's a greater vice:</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Your greater subjects with such force are writ</p>
<p>So full of sinewy strength, as well as wit,</p>
<p>That when you are <i>religious</i>, our divines</p>
<p>May emulate, but not reprove your lines:</p>
<p>And when you reason, there the learned crew</p>
<p>May learn to speculate, and speak from you.</p>
<p>You no profane, no obscene language use</p>
<p>To smut your paper, or defile your Muse.</p>
<p>Your gayest things, as well express'd as meant,</p>
<p>Are equally both quaint and innocent.</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>But your Pindaric Odes indeed are such</p>
<p>That Pindar's lyre from his own skilful touch</p>
<p>Ne'er yielded such an harmony, nor yet</p>
<p>Verse keep such time on so unequal feet.</p>
<p>So by his own generous confession</p>
<p>Great Tasso by Guarini was outdone:</p>
<p>And (which in copying seldom does befall)</p>
<p>The ectype's better than th' original.</p>
<p class="i2">But whilst your fame I labour to send forth,</p>
<p>By the ill-doing it I cloud your worth,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>In something all mankind unhappy are,</p>
<p>And you as mortal too must have your share;</p>
<p>'Tis your misfortune to have found a friend,</p>
<p>Who hurts and injures where he would commend.</p>
<p>But let this be your comfort, that your bays</p>
<p>Shall flourish green, maugre an ill-couch'd praise.</p>

kind of emphasis. The next is almost entirely free from them, and the difference

<p>As when a Prince his standard does erect,</p>

<p class="i4">From such as early take his side,</p>
<p class="i4">And readily obedience yield,</p>

<p>Domestic care, the mind's incurable disease,</p>
<p class="i4">I am resolv'd I will forget.</p>
<p class="i4">Ah! could I hope the restless pain</p>
<p class="i4">Would now entirely cease,</p>
<p class="i4">And never more return again,</p>
<p>My thoughts I would in other order set;</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>By more than protestations I would show,</p>

<h4>III.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>This I would do: but what will our desire avail</p>
<p class="i4">When active heat and vigour fail?</p>
<p>'Tis well thou hast more youthful combatants than I,</p>
<p>Right able to protect thy immortality:</p>
<p class="i2">If envy should attack thy spotless name</p>
<p class="i2">(And that attacks the best of things</p>
<p class="i2">And into rigid censure brings</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>The most undoubted registers of fame),</p>
<p>Their fond artillery let them dispense,</p>
<p>Piercing wit and murd'ring eloquence,</p>
<p class="i2">Noble conceit and manly sense,</p>
<p>Charming numbers let 'em shine</p>
<p class="i2">And dazzle dead in ev'ry line</p>
<p>The most malicious of thy foes,</p>
<p>Though Hell itself should offer to oppose;</p>
<p>I (thy decrepit subject) only can resign</p>
<p>The little life of art is left, to ransom thine:</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="right1">40</span>Fumbling's as bad in poetry,</p>
<p class="i2">And as ridiculous, as 'tis in gallantry:</p>

<p class="i4"><span class="right1">50</span>Let us a while expostulate,</p>
<p class="i4">What heat of glory call'd you on,</p>
<p class="i4">Your learnèd empire to extend</p>
<p>Beyond the limits of your own dominion?</p>
<p>At home, you were already crown'd with bays:</p>
<p>Why foreign trophies do you seek to raise?</p>
<p class="i2">Poets arcanas have of government,</p>
<p>And tho' the homagers of your own continent</p>
<p class="i4">Out of a sense of duty do submit,</p>
<p class="i4">Yet public print a jealousy creates,</p>
<p class="i6"><span class="right1">60</span>And intimates a laid design</p>
<p class="i6">Unto the neighb'ring potentates.</p>
<p class="i4">Now into all your secret arts they pry,</p>
<p class="i4">And weigh each hint by rules of policy.</p>
<p>Offensive leagues they twine,</p>
<p>In councils, rotas, and cabals they sit,</p>
<p class="i4">Each petty burgess thinks it fit</p>
<p class="i4">The Corporation should combine</p>
<p>Against the Universal Monarchy of Wit,</p>
<p>And straight declare for quite abjuring it.</p>

<p>In the main points all European wits agree,</p>
<p>All allow order, art, and rules of decency,</p>
<p>And to be absolutely perfect, ne'er was yet</p>
<p>A beauty such, or such a wit.</p>
<p class="i4">I fear the Pagan and the barbarous,</p>
<p>A nation quite Antipodes to us;</p>
<p>The infidel unletter'd crew (I mean)</p>
<p class="i2">Who call that only wit,</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Which is indeed but the reverse of it;</p>
<p>Creatures in whom civility ne'er shone,</p>
<p>But (unto Nature's contradiction)</p>
<p>It is their glory to be so obscene,</p>
<p>You'd think the legion of th' unclean</p>
<p>Were from the swine (to which they were condemn'd) releas'd,</p>
<p>And had these verier swine (than them) possess'd.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">If these should an advantage take</p>
<p>And on thy fame a depredation make,</p>

<p><span class="right1">90</span>These are the common enemies of our belief and art,</p>

<p>All things with them are measur'd by success:</p>
<p class="i4">If the battle be not won;</p>
<p class="i4">If the author do not sell;</p>
<p>Into their dull capacities it will not sink,</p>
<p>They cannot with deliberation think</p>
<p>How bravely the commander led them on,</p>
<p>No nor wherein the book was written well:</p>
<p><span class="right1">100</span>When ('tis a thing impossible to do)</p>

<p>Strange magic of thy wit and style,</p>

<p>That more of pleasure than regret it brings.</p>

<p>Devour'd the story of their own subverted state.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<h4>II.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Kind Heav'n (as to her darling son) to thee</p>
<p class="i2">A double portion did impart,</p>
<p>A gift of Painting and of Poesy:</p>
<p>But for thy rivals in the painter's art,</p>
<p>If well they represent, they can effect</p>

<p>But more than this <i>thy</i> happy pencils give;</p>
<p>Thy draughts are more than representative,</p>

<p>Ah! worthy friend, couldst thou maintain the state</p>
<p>Of what with so much ease thou dost create,</p>
<p class="i2">We might reflect on death with scorn!</p>

<p>Thy verse is always lofty as the hill,</p>
<p class="i2">Or pleasant as the plain.</p>
<p>How well thy Muse the Pastoral Song improves!</p>
<p>Whose nymphs and swains are in their loves</p>
<p>As innocent, and yet as kind as doves.</p>
<p>But most She moves our wonder and delight,</p>
<p>When She performs her loose Pindaric flight,</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>Oft to their outmost reach She will extend</p>
<p class="i2">Her tow'ring wings to soar on high,</p>
<p class="i2">And then by just degrees descend:</p>
<p class="i2">Oft in a swift strait course She glides,</p>

<p>Perk up his tail, and hop between</p>

<h4>I.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I think thou art not well advised, my friend,</p>
<p>To bring thy spritely Poems on the stage</p>
<p>Now when the Muses' empire 's at an end</p>
<p>And there 's none left that feel poetic rage,</p>
<p>Now Cowley's dead, the glory of the age,</p>
<p>And all the lesser singing birds are starved i'th' cage.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<h4>II.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Nor was it well done to permit my bush,</p>
<p>My holly bush, to hang before thy wine,</p>
<p>For friends' applauses are not worth a rush,</p>
<p>And every fool can get a gilded sign.</p>
<p>In troth I have no faculty at praise;</p>
<p>My bush is very full of thorns, though it seems bays.</p>

<p>When I would praise I cannot find a rhyme,</p>
<p>But if I have a just pretence to rail,</p>
<p>They come in numerous throngs at any time,</p>
<p>Their everlasting fountains never fail,</p>
<p>They come in troops and for employment pray;</p>
<p>If I have any wit, it lies only that way.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<h4>IV.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But yet I'll try, if thou wilt rid thy mind</p>
<p>Of thoughts of rhyming and of writing well,</p>
<p>And bend thy studies to another kind&mdash;</p>
<p>I mean, in craft and riches to excel;</p>
<p>If thou desert thy friends and better wine,</p>
<p>And pay'st no more attendance on the needy Nine.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<h4>V.</h4>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Go, and renounce thy wit and thy good parts&mdash;</p>
<p>Wit and good parts, great enemies to wealth,&mdash;</p>
<p>And barter honesty for more thriving arts,</p>
<p>Prize gold before a good name, ease, and health.</p>

<i>On the Death of the Earl of Ossory.</i>] Thomas Butler (1634-80), by courtesy Earl of
Ossory, though not exactly a Marcellus (for he was forty-six when he died), holds
a distinguished place among those who have died too soon. He was a soldier, a sailor,
a statesman; if not an orator, an effective speaker; and though no milksop or 'good
boy', one emphatically, 'of the right sort'. The excellent first line (see Introduction)
is well supported by the whole opening quatrain; and it has been left, typographically,
as it appears in the original. The rest may undergo the usual law. The poem was
first issued in folio in 1681: 'be' was read for 'grow' in l. 63.</p>

<p>58 The French rhyme, as if 'dés<i>ir</i>', is not uninteresting.

<i>The Review.</i>] Dated in the Firth MS. December 17, 1666. Entered in the Stationers'
Register on December 17, 1673, as 'A poem or copy intituled the Review, To the Reverend
my honored freind Dr. Wm. Sancroft, Deane of St. Paules, A Pindarique Ode'.
Similarly in the Firth MS. 'The Review. A Pindarique Ode. To the Reverend, my
worthy friend, Dr. Wm. Sandcroft, Dean of St. Paul's': the chief variants only are
recorded. The words 'now Lord Archbishop of Canterbury' are added in the fourth
edition. In the earlier editions&mdash;even that of 1682, when Sancroft had been Primate
for four years&mdash;the poem is addressed 'to Dr. W. S.' The piece is a rather remarkable
'Religio <i>Laici</i>' for the time, and as anticipating Dryden's; and has some, though
rather vague, autobiographic interest. It seems (<i>v.</i> Commendatory Poems) to have
attracted some attention as such.</p>

ordinary person. As such he might have been, as he was, a St. Paul's boy and an
Oxford (Wadham) man, a member of the Inner Temple, an early F.R.S., and later
a Canon of Chichester and Winchester. But as such merely he would hardly have been,
in the Preface to his Paraphrases of the Canticles (<i>v. inf.</i>, <a href="#page366a">p. 366</a>), the first, and for
a long time the only, 'ingoing' critic of Milton's blank verse. He does not take quite the

<i>Hymn for the Morning.</i>] This Hymn will of course suggest Ken's infinitely better-known
one to everybody. The facts are curious and not quite fully given in
Mr. Julian's invaluable <i>Dictionary of Hymnology</i>, where it is not mentioned that Ken
and Flatman were both Winchester and New College men of almost exactly the same
age and standing. Moreover, Sir Thomas Browne&mdash;also a Wykehamist and their contemporary,
though a senior&mdash;has another very similar composition&mdash;one of his rare
exercises in verse&mdash;towards the end of <i>Religio Medici</i>. The triple connexion with
Winchester, and with Latin hymns known to be in use there, is pretty striking, though
the matter cannot be followed out here. It is enough to say that the resemblance is
chiefly confined to the opening. In the <i>Evening</i> hymns of the two this resemblance is
still slighter, though there are passages, naturally enough, that approach each other.
Ken's hymns were not <i>published</i> till 1695; but in 1674, the very years of Flatman's
original issue, they are palpably referred to in the future bishop's and actual prebendary's
<i>Manual of Prayers for the use of the Scholars of Winchester College</i>. Browne's piece
must be at least forty years older.</p>

the earlier 'thought' on the same subject. The copy in the Firth MS. reads 'dear'

<p>He that has never yet acquainted been</p>
<p>With cruel Chance, nor Virtue naked seen,</p>
<p>Stripp'd from th' advantages (which vices wear)</p>
<p>Of happy, plausible, successful, fair;</p>
<p>Nor learnt how long the low'ring cloud may last,</p>
<p>Wherewith her beauteous face is overcast,</p>
<p>Till she her native glories does recover,</p>
<p>And shines more bright, after the storm is over;</p>
<p>To be inform'd, he need no further go,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>Than this Divine Epitome of woe.</p>
<p>In Johnson's Life and Writings he may find,</p>
<p>What Homer in his Odysses design'd,</p>
<p>A virtuous man, by miserable fate,</p>
<p>Rend'red ten thousand ways unfortunate;</p>
<p>Sometimes within a leaking vessel tost,</p>
<p>All hopes of life and the lov'd shore quite lost,</p>
<p>While hidden sands, and every greedy wave</p>
<p>With horror gap'd themselves into a grave:</p>
<p>Sometimes upon a rock with fury thrown,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>Moaning himself, where none could hear his moan;</p>
<p>Sometimes cast out upon the barren sand,</p>
<p>Expos'd to th' mercy of a barbarous land:</p>
<p>Such was the pious Johnson, till kind Heaven</p>
<p>A blessèd end to all his toils had given:</p>
<p>To show that virtuous men, though they appear</p>
<p>But Fortune's sport, are Providence's care.</p>

<i>Virtus sola manet.</i>] These Alcaics look like a college exercise, in which kind there
have been worse. The third lines, as usual, are the weakest parts. But the English is
perhaps better. The decasyllabic quatrain, though practised by Davies, by Davenant,
and recently and best of all by Dryden, in <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, has qualities which it
remained for Gray to bring out fully, but which Flatman has not quite missed here.
I wonder if Gray knew the piece, especially Stanza III?</p>

<i>Elegy on the Earl of Sandwich.</i>] Pepys's (the first) Earl, who perished at the fight of
Solebay in 1672. The duplication (see next piece) looks as if Flatman had had some
personal connexion with him. At any rate there are expressions which are not the
mere conventions of such writing. Line 6, and in fact the whole vigorous triplet in
which it occurs, must be connected with the nearly certain facts that Sandwich's advice
would have prevented the most unfavourable of the conditions under which the English
fought; that the Duke of York not only would not listen but hinted at cowardice on
Sandwich's part; and that the Earl in consequence, not only, as Mr. David Hannay
(<i>A Short History of the Royal Navy</i>, i. 423) says, 'fought the ship on this the last and
most glorious day of his life, with determined courage', but refused to attempt to save his
life by swimming, when she was grappled by a fireship and burnt. Moreover, the last
lines express the fact that the body was only recovered after being washed ashore some
days after the battle, when it was duly buried in Westminster Abbey, 'the bed of
honour and of kings'.</p>

been at no loss for verse or rhyme&mdash;should have suddenly run dry of the latter in his
first and third lines. If he had not been so stingy the piece might have been worth

<div class="ind1"><p>
<i>To Mr. Sam. Austin.</i>] Samuel Austin the younger (his father of the same name
was a respectable divine and a writer of sacred verse of the preceding generation) was
a Wadham man, a contemporary of Flatman's, and a common Oxford butt for conceit
and affectation. His <i>Panegyric on the Restoration</i> appeared in 1661, and contained
a statement that the author 'intended a larger book of poems according as these find
acceptance'. He had taken his degree five years earlier, and his poetry, probably in
MS., had been soon afterwards made the subject of one of the liveliest and naughtiest
of Oxford skits, <i>Naps on Parnassus</i> (London, 1658), where some of Austin's own
lucubrations, and more parodies and lampoons on him, appear&mdash;side-noted with quaint
and scandalous <i>adversaria</i>. Flatman himself contributed, among others, some kitchen-Latin
leonines:</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
        <p>O decus Anglorum! vates famose tuorum</p>
        <p>Cujus pars nona facit Oxenford Helicona,</p>

<p>&amp;c., sometimes dropping into a sort of Macaronic, or at least mongrel dialect:</p>

<div class="poem width27"><div class="stanza">
        <p>Haec ratio non est&mdash;quid rides?&mdash;my meaning's honest.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The elder Samuel Austin, a Cornishman, of Exeter, was a very serious person who
wrote, and after difficulties got published in 1629, <i>Austin's Urania, or the Heavenly Muse</i>,
with the most unreasonable motto <i>Aut perlegas aut non legas</i>&mdash;rendered</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
        <p>Whate'er thou be whose eye do chance to fall</p>
        <p>Upon this Book, read all or none at all.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For a considerable time I obeyed the second part of this injunction only.</p>

<p><i>Naps on Parnassus</i> has some important variants and some corrections of the present
text. Omitting minor changes, these are:&mdash;</p>

<p>2 obscure] abstruse.</p>

<p>5 what all] what riddles? all (Clearly the right text).</p>

<p>After 16 is the couplet:</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
        <p>There were Philosophers content to be</p>
        <p>Renown'd, and famous in obscurity.</p>

<p>Line 18 has a marginal note on 'scower'&mdash;'But when he does so, he verifies the
Proverb, viz. Æthiopem lavat.'</p>

<p>Lines 29, 30 read:</p>

        <p>O were your verses stol'n, that so we might</p>
        <p>Hope in good time to see them come to light.</p>
</div></div>

<p>After line 36 is the couplet:</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
        <p>I hope some wit when he your honour hears,</p>
        <p>Will praise your mother's eyes' turpentine tears.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In line 42 is printed 'everlastin' with the note '[g] aufertur in fine, per Apocopen'.</p>

<p>4 The blessed word 'stero (it should be 'ste<i>rr</i>o' or 'ste<i>re</i>o') -pegeretic' (a rather
erratic compound from <ins title="Greek: pêgnymi">&pi;&#8053;&gamma;&nu;&upsilon;&mu;&iota;</ins>) is very likely Austin's own for 'strongly put together'.</p>

<i>On Mrs. E. Montague, &amp;c.</i>] This, though I do not know exactly who the lady was,
may be taken with the Sandwich epicedes as evidence of Flatman's acquaintance with the
Montague family. It is odd that Pepys does not mention him, especially as he does
record buying the 'Montelion' Almanack for 1661, which has been attributed to our
poet. The Cross-Bath is of course the famous one at Bath itself, which was then the
most fashionable, and was visited and used by Pepys himself. It is now 'drawn to the
dregs of a democracy'&mdash;a cheap public swimming-bath, at a penny entrance or twopence
with towel. Flatman's comparison of a blushing cheek to a judge on the bench is
worthy of Cleveland, or even of Benlowes. But the extravagance was doubtless, in part
at least, conscious.</p>

<i>On the Death of the Earl of Rochester.</i>] Flatman, it will be observed, makes no
reference to Burnet's notorious publication as to Rochester's death-bed repentance. As
to the Latin version, he strains the term 'leonine', which ought properly to be used
only of lines correctly metred, or intended for metre, but rhymed at middle and end.
(He had actually written such: <i>v. sup.</i>, <a href="#page353">p. 353</a>). But these verses, added in 1686, are not
uninteresting examples of Latin, metred on English principles and rhymed in stanza,
of the same class as Sir F. Kynaston's <i>Troilus</i>, though in different form.</p>

<p>MS. versions are in Bodley, in Aubrey MS. 6, fol. 56 (with the variant 'head' in l. 14),
and a worthless copy in MS. Add. B. 105, fol. 19.</p>

<p class="center2"><i>Protesilaus lying windbound at Aulis in the Grecian fleet design'd for the<br />
Trojan war, his wife Laodamia sends this following Epistle to him.</i></p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Health to the gentle man of war, and may</p>
<p>What Laodamia sends the Gods convey.</p>
<p>The wind that still in Aulis holds my dear,</p>
<p>Why was it not so cross to keep him here?</p>
<p>Let the wind raise an hurricane at sea,</p>
<p>Were he but safe and warm ashore with me.</p>
<p>Ten thousand kisses I had more to give him,</p>
<p>Ten thousand cautions, and soft words to leave him:</p>
<p>In haste he left me, summon'd by the wind,</p>
<p><span class="right1">10</span>(The wind to barbarous mariners only kind).</p>
<p>The seaman's pleasure is the lover's pain,</p>
<p>(Protesilaus from my bosom ta'en!)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span></p>
<p>As from my faltering tongue half speeches fell,</p>
<p>Scarce could I speak that wounding word <i>Farewell</i>,</p>
<p>A merry gale (at sea they call it so)</p>
<p>Fill'd every sail with joy, my breast with woe,</p>
<p>There went my dear Protesilaus&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>While I could see thee, full of eager pain,</p>
<p>My greedy eyes epicuris'd on thine,</p>
<p><span class="right1">20</span>When thee no more, but thy spread sails I view,</p>
<p>I look'd, and look'd, till I had lost them too;</p>
<p>But when nor thee, nor them I could descry,</p>
<p>And all was sea that came within my eye,</p>
<p>They say (for I have quite forgot), they say</p>
<p>I straight grew pale, and fainted quite away;</p>
<p>Compassionate Iphiclus, and the good old man,</p>
<p>My mother too to my assistance ran;</p>
<p>In haste cold water on my face they threw,</p>
<p>And brought me to myself with much ado.</p>
<p><span class="right1">30</span>They meant it well, to me it seem'd not so,</p>
<p>Much kinder had they been to let me go;</p>
<p>My anguish with my soul together came,</p>
<p>And in my heart burst out the former flame:</p>
<p>Since which, my uncomb'd locks unheeded flow,</p>
<p>Undrest, forlorn, I care not how I go;</p>
<p>Inspir'd with wine, thus Bacchus' frolic rout</p>
<p>Stagger'd of old, and straggled all about.</p>
<p>Put on, put on, the happy ladies say,</p>
<p>Thy royal robes, fair Laodamia.</p>
<p><span class="right1">40</span>Alas! before Troy's walls my dear does lie,</p>
<p>What pleasure can I take in Tyrian dye?</p>
<p>Shall curls adorn my head, an helmet thine?</p>
<p>I in bright tissues, thou in armour shine?</p>
<p>Rather with studied negligence I'll be</p>
<p>As ill, if not disguisèd worse than thee.</p>
<p class="i2">O Paris! rais'd by ruins! mayst thou prove</p>
<p>As fatal in thy war, as in thy love!</p>
<p>O that the Grecian Dame had been less fair,</p>
<p>Or thou less lovely hadst appear'd to her!</p>
<p><span class="right1">50</span>O Menelaus! timely cease to strive,</p>
<p>With how much blood wilt thou thy loss retrieve?</p>
<p>From me, ye Gods, avert your heavy doom,</p>
<p>And bring my dear, laden with laurels, home:</p>
<p>But my heart fails me, when I think of war,</p>
<p>The sad reflection costs me many a tear:</p>
<p>I tremble when I hear the very name</p>
<p>Of every place where thou shalt fight for fame;</p>
<p>Besides, th' adventurous ravisher well knew</p>
<p>The safest arts his villany to pursue;</p>
<p><span class="right1">60</span>In noble dress he did her heart surprise,</p>
<p>With gold he dazzled her unguarded eyes,</p>
<p>He back'd his rape with ships and armèd men,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span></p>
<p>Thus storm'd, thus took the beauteous fortress in.</p>
<p>Against the power of Love and force of arms</p>
<p>There's no security in the brightest charms.</p>
<p class="i2">Hector I fear, much do I Hector fear,</p>
<p>A man (they say) experienc'd in war,</p>
<p>My dear, if thou hast any love for me,</p>
<p>Of that same Hector prithee mindful be;</p>
<p><span class="right1">70</span>Fly him be sure, and every other foe,</p>
<p>Lest each of them should prove an Hector too.</p>
<p>Remember, when for fight thou shalt prepare,</p>
<p>Thy Laodamia charg'd thee, Have a care;</p>
<p>For what wounds thou receiv'st are giv'n to her.</p>
<p>If by thy valour Troy must ruin'd be,</p>
<p>May not the ruin leave one scar on thee;</p>
<p>Sharer in th' honour, from the danger free!</p>
<p>Let Menelaus fight, and force his way</p>
<p>Through the false ravisher's troops t' his Helena.</p>
<p><span class="right1">80</span>Great be his victory, as his cause is good.</p>
<p>May he swim to her in his enemies' blood.</p>
<p>Thy case is different.&mdash;Mayst thou live to see</p>
<p>(Dearest) no other combatant but me!</p>
<p class="i2">Ye generous Trojans, turn your swords away</p>
<p>From his dear breast, find out a nobler prey;</p>
<p>Why should you harmless Laodamia slay?</p>
<p>My poor good-natur'd man did never know</p>
<p>What 'tis to fight, or how to face a foe;</p>
<p>Yet in Love's field what wonders can he do!</p>
<p><span class="right1">90</span>Great is his prowess and his fortune too;</p>
<p>Let them go fight, who know not how to woo.</p>
<p class="i2">Now I must own, I fear'd to let thee go,</p>
<p>My trembling lips had almost told thee so.</p>
<p>When from thy father's house thou didst withdraw,</p>
<p>Thy fatal stumble at the door I saw,</p>
<p>I saw it, sigh'd, and pray'd the sign might be</p>
<p>Of thy return a happy prophecy!</p>
<p>I cannot but acquaint thee with my fear,</p>
<p>Be not too brave,&mdash;Remember,&mdash;Have a care,</p>
<p><span class="right1">100</span>And all my dreads will vanish into air.</p>
<p class="i2">Among the Grecians some one must be found</p>
<p>That first shall set his foot on Trojan ground;</p>
<p>Unhappy she that shall his loss bewail,</p>
<p>Grant, O ye Gods, thy courage then may fail.</p>
<p class="i2">Of all the ships be thine the very last,</p>
<p>Thou the last man that lands; there needs no haste</p>
<p>To meet a potent and a treacherous foe;</p>
<p>Thou'lt land I fear too soon, tho' ne'er so slow.</p>
<p>At thy return ply every sail and oar,</p>
<p><span class="right1">110</span>And nimbly leap on thy deserted shore.</p>
<p class="i2">All the day long, and all the lonely night,</p>
<p>Black thoughts of thee my anxious soul affright:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span></p>
<p>Darkness, to other women's pleasures kind,</p>
<p>Augments, like Hell, the torments of my mind.</p>
<p>I court e'en dreams, on my forsaken bed</p>
<p>False joys must serve, since all my true are fled.</p>
<p>What's that same airy phantom so like thee!</p>
<p>What wailings do I hear, what paleness see?</p>
<p>I wake, and hug myself, 'tis but a dream.&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="right1">120</span>The Grecian altars know I feed their flame,</p>
<p>The want of hallow'd wine my tears supply,</p>
<p>Which make the sacred fire burn bright and high.</p>
<p class="i2">When shall I clasp thee in these arms of mine,</p>
<p>These longing arms, and lie dissolv'd in thine?</p>
<p>When shall I have thee by thyself alone,</p>
<p>To learn the wondrous actions thou hast done?</p>
<p>Which when in rapturous words thou hast begun</p>
<p>With many and many a kiss, prithee tell on,</p>
<p>Such interruptions grateful pauses are,</p>
<p><span class="right1">130</span>A kiss in story's but an halt in war.</p>
<p class="i2">But, when I think of Troy, of winds and waves,</p>
<p>I fear the pleasant dream my hope deceives:</p>
<p>Contrary winds in port detain thee too,</p>
<p>In spite of wind and tide why wouldst thou go?</p>
<p>Thus, to thy country thou wouldst hardly come,</p>
<p>In spite of wind and tide thou went'st from home.</p>
<p>To his own city Neptune stops the way,</p>
<p>Revere the omen, and the Gods obey.</p>
<p>Return, ye furious Grecians, homeward fly,</p>
<p><span class="right1">140</span>Your stay is not of Chance, but Destiny:</p>
<p>How can your arms expect desir'd success,</p>
<p>That thus contend for an adulteress?</p>
<p>But, let not me forespeak you, no,&mdash;set sail,</p>
<p>And Heav'n befriend you with a prosperous gale!</p>
<p class="i2">Ye Trojans! with regret methinks I see</p>
<p>Your first encounter with your enemy;</p>
<p>I see fair Helen put on all her charms,</p>
<p>To buckle on her lusty bridegroom's arms;</p>
<p>She gives him arms, and kisses she receives,</p>
<p><span class="right1">150</span>(I hate the transports each to other gives.)</p>
<p>She leads him forth, and she commands him come</p>
<p>Safely victorious, and triumphant home;</p>
<p>And he (no doubt) will make no nice delay,</p>
<p>But diligently do whate'er she say.</p>
<p>Now he returns!&mdash;see with what amorous speed</p>
<p>She takes the pond'rous helmet from his head,</p>
<p>And courts the weary champion to her bed.</p>
<p class="i2"><i>We women, too too credulous, alas!</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Think what we fear will surely come to pass</i>.</p>
<p><span class="right1">160</span>Yet, while before the leaguer thou dost lie,</p>
<p>Thy picture is some pleasure to my eye;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span></p>
<p>That, I caress in words most kind and free,</p>
<p>And lodge it on my breast, as I would thee.</p>
<p>There must be something in it more than Art,</p>
<p>'Twere very thee, could it thy mind impart;</p>
<p>I kiss the pretty Idol, and complain,</p>
<p>As if (like thee) 'twould answer me again.</p>
<p class="i2">By thy return, by thy dear self, I swear,</p>
<p>By our Love's vows, which most religious are,</p>
<p><span class="right1">170</span>By thy belovèd head, and those gray hairs</p>
<p>Which time may on it snow in future years,</p>
<p>I come, where'er thy Fate shall bid thee go,</p>
<p>Eternal partner of thy weal and woe,</p>
<p>So thou but live, tho' all the Gods say No.</p>
<p class="i2">Farewell,&mdash;but prithee very careful be</p>
<p class="i2">Of thy belovèd Self (I mean) of me.</p>

<p>Alexis seems to be Richard Flatman, Oldham Menalcas, the poet himself
Astragon. It is curious that the printers&mdash;and perhaps even the writers&mdash;of this time
were so besotted with 'apostrophation' as even to use it when the full value is
metrically necessary, as here in 'wouldn't', which must be 'would <i>not</i>' to scan.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 13, 1682.</i></p>

<div class="ind1"><p>
<i>On the Death of Prince Rupert.</i>]  First printed in folio, 1683; there are two trivial
changes in the text&mdash;'Blest Martyr baptized', l. 87, and 'Diadems', l. 128. That both
the English and the Latin of these poems are Flatman's, despite the <i>Authore Anonymo</i>
of the latter, is a conclusion which I shall give up at once on production of any positive
evidence to the contrary, but shall hold meanwhile. Rupert's love for the Arts would
of itself attract Flatman, and he hints at this in ll. 16 and 65.</p>

<p>21 The 'prime skilfulness' may glance at Dryden&mdash;there were few others who were
primely skilful at funeral odes or any other in 1682. But Rupert had kept aloof from
Court for years.</p>

<p>74-6 Orig. 'displaid' and 'dismaid': but not 'pr<i>ai</i>d'.</p>

<p>90-4 A rather ingenious handling of those adventurous and almost heroic cruises of
Rupert's with the remnant of the Royalist fleet which some have unkindly (and in strictness
quite unjustifiably) called 'buccaneering' or 'piratical'.</p>

<p>111-29 One would have expected, instead of the banal laudation of Charles, something
about Rupert's share in the Dutch wars, and his occupations in chemistry,
engraving, &amp;c. But there was perhaps some ox on Flatman's tongue (for the Prince
had not been fortunate at the last in fight); and, besides, all these later poems show a
want of the spirit and the verve which is by no means wanting in the earlier. The
words to Woodford (<i>v. sup.</i>, <a href="#page367">p. 367</a>) were rather too well justified.</p>

<p>25 Browning somewhere in a letter laughs at this line, in the form 'Kings do not
die, they only disappear', which is neither Flatman's nor Waller's, from whom he
borrowed the notion, nor Oldham's, who has it likewise, though both these have the
'disappear'. The thought is not foolish: it means, 'their names and works live after
them'. But Browning's knowledge of Flatman, as of other out-of-the-ways, is interesting.
He might have made him a 'Person of Importance'.</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>It was a lovely melancholy night;</p>
<p class="i2">The Moon, and every star shone bright;</p>
<p>When thou didst swear thou wouldst to me be true,</p>
<p class="i2">And do as I would have thee do:</p>
<p>False woman! round my neck thy arms did twine,</p>
<p class="i2">Inseparable as the elm and vine:</p>
<p>Then didst thou swear thy passion should endure</p>
<p class="i2">To me alone sincere and pure,</p>
<p>Till sheep and wolves should quit their enmity,</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="right1">10</span>And not a wave disturb the sea.</p>
<p>Treacherous Neaera! I have been too kind,</p>
<p class="i2">But Flaccus can draw off, thou'lt find;</p>
<p>He can that face (as thou dost him) forswear,</p>
<p class="i2">And find (it may be) one as fair:</p>
<p>And let me tell thee, when my fury's mov'd,</p>
<p class="i2">I hate devoutly, as I lov'd.</p>
<p>But thou, blest gamester, whosoe'er thou be</p>
<p class="i2">That proudly dost my drudgery,</p>
<p>Didst thou abound in numerous flocks, and land,</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="right1">20</span>Wert heir to all Pactolus' sand;</p>
<p>Though in thy brain thou bor'st Pythagoras,</p>
<p class="i2">And carried'st Nereus in thy face,</p>
<p>She'd pick another up, and shab thee off,</p>
<p class="i2">And then 'twill be my turn to laugh.</p>

<div class="ind1"><p>
XV. 23 'Shab off' seems to be still provincially used both in the intransitive sense
'<i>sneak</i> off' and in the transitive as here '<i>bundle</i> off.'</p>

<h2>POEMS NOT INCLUDED IN THE EDITIONS OF 1682 AND 1686.</h2>

<p>The sources from which these miscellaneous poems are taken are noted separately.
Two, at the time of going to press, have not been printed&mdash;the <i>Song</i> 'Oh
no, oh no!' (<a href="#page414a">p. 414</a>) and the <i>Paraphrase</i> of the 27th Chapter of Job (<a href="#page420a">p. 420</a>).</p>

<p>There is evidence that Flatman contemplated one more Pindaric, but perhaps it
was not written, and certainly not printed. The subject was to be Admiral Myngs. The
<i>Familiar Letters of Love, Gallantry, and Several Occasions</i>, 1718, vol. i,
pp. 249 foll., include a letter of consolation to Flatman's 'Honoured Master', in which he
writes, after some preliminary comments: 'Not to hold you any longer in suspense, my
Noble, my Generous Friend, the Glory of the Sea, the Astonishment of all the
World, is dead. When I have told you this, you cannot be ignorant of the Person I mean;
he has a Name too big to be concealed from any body that ever heard of Wonder on
the Deep, or understands what 'tis to be brave, to be valiant, to be loyal, to
be kind and honourable, more than all this is too little to describe Sir <i>Christopher
Myngs</i>. Guess, my Dearest Master, the Disturbance so irreparable a Loss must create in
one often honour'd with his Conversation, and many Ways oblig'd by him. We have
nothing left of him now but poor sorrowful <i>Syl. Taylour</i>, that other Half
of his Soul, who is now resolv'd for Retirement, and will run no more Hazards at Sea. Many
more Things I might misemploy you with, but this great load must be first removed,
which, I think, will not be, till I have vented my Grief in a Pindarique, and done the
last Office of Kindness for the Dead. If I can make my Sorrows any thing legible,
expect to bear a Part in them.' The letter is dated from London on June 15, 1666.</p>

<p>Another lost poem&mdash;doubtless a Pindaric&mdash;on the theme of London is thus referred
to in an autograph letter to Sancroft written from St. Catharine Hall,
Cambridge, on May 13, 1667 (Tanner MS. xlv, fol. 188):</p>

<p>'When I was last with you you were pleasd to take away from me a paper of
imperfect Verses, the first desseign wherof was to comply with your injunction
in saying something on that subject, whose beuty (it may be) had it continued in
that flourishing condition 'twas in at the time of the imposition of yo^r commaunds,
might haue heightned my thoughts as much as it's ruin has now dejected them; or to
speak in my owne way, The Coppy had bin much livelier if th' Originall hadnt bin
so much defaced; and he must be a better Architect then I that can reare a
structure any thing magnificent in so bare an Ichnography. Thus much S^r to let you know how
much I am beholding to yo^r forgetfulness in returning my Ode, wherby you haue
cover'd many imperfections, &amp; kept me from being any longer angry with my self
for not finishing what had better never bin begun.'</p>

<p>One poem, sometimes assigned to Flatman has not been reprinted here&mdash;<i>A
Panegyric to his Renowned Majesty, Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, &amp;c.</i>, a
folio sheet issued in 1660, with the initials 'T. F.', and beginning 'Return, return,
strange prodigy of fate!' Flatman, if it had been his, would not have failed to reprint
it in his own <i>Poems</i>. Similarly with an anonymous poem on the coronation of
James II&mdash;<i>To the King, a Congratulatory Poem</i>, printed for R. Bentley in 1685&mdash;which Mr.
W. C. Hazlitt in his <i>Collections and Notes</i>, ii, p. 694, ascribes to Flatman. It begins:</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Dread Sir, since it has pleas'd the Pow'rs above</p>
<p>To take the other Object of our love.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This has a faint verbal resemblance to the opening of Flatman's genuine poem on
James (see <a href="#page394a">p. 394</a>), and the misattribution may be due to this.</p>

<div class="ind1"><p>
<i>Upon a Chine of Beef.</i>] Of doubtful authenticity. The Horatian adaptation on
<a href="#page356">pp. 356-9</a> perhaps confirms it, and we may note the oath (of Flatman's own coinage)
at l. 138 of that poem, 'By sturdy Chine of Beef, and mighty Jove'. The text is taken
from the anonymous version in <i>Wit's Interpreter</i>, 1655, collected by John Cotgrave: it
appears on pp. 268-9 of the <i>Love-Songs, Epigrams, &amp;c.</i> An inferior text in <i>Wit and
Mirth. An Antidote to Melancholy</i>, 3rd edition, 1682, p. 102, is headed '<i>On a Chine
of Beef.</i> By Mr. Tho. Flatman.' If genuine, this is therefore an early effort; it might
be an undergraduate flight, like the parody on Austin.</p>

<p>The chief variants in <i>Wit and Mirth</i> are:&mdash;</p>

<p>2 'Far longer'.</p>

<p>10 'storm'd'.</p>

<p>12 'seem'd'.</p>

<p>19 'What goodly mince did appear'.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO NATHANIEL WHITING.</h2>

<p>In the case of most of the constituents of these volumes, there was little
need of 'deliberating and pondering' like the excellent Sir Thomas Bertram,
when he had to settle such weighty questions as whether his niece should
or should not go out to dinner, and if so whether she should walk or drive.
But it was not quite the same in regard to <i>Albino and Bellama</i>. The first
claim of entrants here&mdash;rarity and novelty to the general, it has without
question: for the book (though it seems to have been issued in two forms, or
at least with two title-pages) is very uncommon, and the author has escaped
the wide-encroaching net of the <i>D.N.B.</i> Nor could I allow this to be
balanced by the dull, clumsy, philistine, hackneyed ribaldry of the nunnery
scenes in the middle, or by a page of sheer nastiness at the end, which is
a sort of concentration of Herrick's foulest epigrams. These things will
happen: and they can be skipped. It gave one more serious pause that
'N. W.' seldom<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> displays anything like the poetry which far more than
compensates for much milder blots in <i>Leoline and Sydanis</i>, and that his book is
written in a singular jargon almost as much out of the common way as the
wildest freaks of Benlowes, but without their excuse of <i>furor poeticus</i>.
What turned the scale in his favour, after more than one reading, was the increasing
conviction that the book, in spite or perhaps to some extent because of its
defects, is a really valuable document for the history of English Literature
from the special point of view which was marked out in the General Introduction.
It is noteworthy as a member, graceless and slatternly, but still
a member, of that class of Heroic Poem which it has been one of my main
objects to bring before the student. It is still more noteworthy in connexion
with the history of English fiction as presenting a special variety of that kind.
It was not till, for the purposes of this collection, and by the kindness of
Professor Firth, who lent me his copy, I read the volume (I knew it before
only by name and from the <i>Censura Literaria</i>) that a gap in my mind's
atlas of that fiction was filled in satisfactorily.</p>

<p>I said, in speaking of <i>Leoline and Sydanis</i>, that we must take not merely
the Heroic but the Mock-Heroic poem into consideration as origins for our
English examples; and this is very much more the case with <i>Albino and</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[page&nbsp;425]</span>
<i>Bellama</i>. Whiting almost parades his knowledge of Italian; and I should
think, from some of the worst as well as the oddest parts of his poem, that he
had pushed his researches as far as Macaronic. In fact you must go beyond
Folengo&mdash;to Tifi Odassi and Fossa Cremonese<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>&mdash;to supply a 'further' to
his excursions, into the unsavoury now and then. But turning willingly
enough from this, it will be evident to any instructed reader&mdash;and his
perlusive panegyrists point it out&mdash;that his purpose is largely satiric. Indeed,
his uncouth lingo<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> has a close connexion with that of Marston and the
other early Elizabethan satirists forty years before him: while he gives one
odd reminders, at the same time, of the prose pamphlet which was contemporary
with these very satirists, and was actually written by some of
them. Now all these links are links with the history of the Novel backwards;
and there are others forward. Change the romance apparatus into
that of common life, of which our examples are French and Spanish
rather than Italian, and you will get out of parts of <i>Albino and Bellama</i>
something by no means unlike the singular farrago which goes under the
name of <i>The English Rogue</i>. Besides convincing the author that prose is
much better for such work than verse (which Head himself saw<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>), present
him with more wits, better taste, and a more advanced state of society and
manners, and you will probably find him some way on the road which leads,
however far away, and after whatever rise, over the hills beyond his dirty
marsh, to <i>Tom Jones</i> itself. While, to make a less 'kangaroo' transition
in quality though a farther one in time, much smaller alteration would
make <i>Albino and Bellama</i> into very fair Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>The curious addition <i>Il Insonio Insonadado</i> or 'Waking-Dream Undreamt'
(whether the title is invented or borrowed, some one with greater knowledge
of Spanish than I possess must decide) may supply some greater interest
than Whiting's escapade in the Heroic Romance. It is not continuously
paged with the rest of the volume, but merely 'signatured' H, H2, &amp;c. as
far as a (misprinted) 5. On the whole, however, it is much less carelessly
put to press than <i>Albino and Bellama</i>, and it is also (in parts at least)
much more soberly written. The opening does not promise much, except an
example of the loose, would-be satirical academic commonplaces of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[page&nbsp;426]</span>
time; but it afterwards takes on some critical substance, and if I had read it
(as I had not yet) twenty years ago I should have given it a small corner
in an otherwise very scantily occupied chapter of my <i>History of Criticism</i>.
Whether the personages introduced before the Heavenly Court aim at
individuals it would be very hard to say: but the certification of the
poetess<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> might have some interest. 'Tenth Muses', as was said in relation
to Anne King (<i>v. sup.</i>, p. <span class="sc">210</span>), were not unknown, and Katharine
Philips was alive, though as yet but a child. But women had, before her, made little
figure in English literature. The evidences of popular taste are not quite
worthless, and while the absence of Ben Jonson is noteworthy, the presence
of Drummond is almost equally so, as well as the mention of that 'testiness'
which certainly does appear in the poet of Hawthornden. But the chief
critical utterance is the quatrain, solid and judicial if not very poetical, on Donne.</p>

<p>Of Whiting himself I have been able to find out very little.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was of
Queens' College, Cambridge; Brydges erroneously says 'King's', having
misread the misprinted 'Regnalis' of James Bernard's commendatory poem.
And he must have settled down twenty years later sufficiently to print in
1659, according to Hazlitt, <i>The Saint's Triangle of Duties, Deliverances,
and Dangers</i>. The first edition of <i>Albino and Bellama</i> appeared in
1637, with the title <i>Le hore di recreatione: Or, The Pleasant Historie of
Albino and Bellama.... By N. W., Master of Arts, of Queenes Colledge in
Cambridge</i>. The British Museum also has a copy with an engraved
frontispiece as well, adding <i>to which is annexed il insonio insonodado</i> or
the <i>vindication of Poesye</i>. These title-pages are also dated 1638, and the
engraved title-page was also issued in 1639.</p>

<p>In 1633 the birth of the Duke of York was commemorated at Cambridge
in <i>Ducis Eboracensis Fasciae a Musis Cantabrigiensibus raptim
contextae</i>. 'N. Whyting, Coll. Regin. Art. Baccal.' contributes two copies of
verse, Latin and Greek, both markedly royalist in tone.</p>

<p>It was not, however, for some time after I had been working on Whiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[page&nbsp;427]</span>
that I found considerable new light thrown on him by his prose work,
which is in the British Museum, under his name, though <i>Albino and
Bellama</i> is not. The title of it is abbreviated by Hazlitt, and is in the original very long,
beginning with the Hebrew <ins title="Hebrew: el ... bayit ... Eil (to [the] house [of] God)"> &#1488;&#1500; ... &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; ... &#1488;&#1500; </ins>
&nbsp;<i>Old Jacob's Altar newly repaired; or The Saints' Triangle of Dangers,
Deliverances and Duties</i>. It is a solid little quarto of some 260 pages, dedicated to
Sir William Fleetwood, Sir George Fleetwood, 'Baron of Swonholm in
Sweadland', and 'his Excellency Charles Lord Fleetwood'. Whiting was
now 'Minister' of Aldwinckle (All Saints, as the registers show<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>)
by the patronage of Sir William, to whom he refers as his 'ancient' and
'affectionate Mecaenas' in his Cambridge days. He is certainly by this
time a full-blown Puritan. He uses that word itself frequently, and
with pride; refers to 'my reverend grandfather', minister of Elton,
Northants, who was apparently a 'pilgrim father'; speaks of the time
when 'the Episcopal monopoly lasted', and eulogizes 'the faithful
Peters to whom is committed the Word of Reconciliation' (Reconciliation
<i>à la</i> Peters is good!); but also calls Herbert 'divine' and quotes
St. Anselm, though of course without the 'Saint'. Allowing for its standpoint
the book is not virulent, and is a respectable piece of hortatory divinity on
its own side. Besides, the thought that in a few months 'the Episcopal
monopoly' came back again, and that 'the faithful Peters' received the
deferred pay for his various 'commissions', mitigates judgement not a little;
while, to crown all, the contrast with <i>Albino and Bellama</i> is irresistibly
comic. Perhaps, indeed, some of the ribaldry of the convent scenes in
the verse may be due to the Puritanism which is so distinct in the prose.
But it would be an odd Saint who could construct himself a 'triangle' of
any kind of sanctities or pious experiences out of Whiting's romance. And
this, which is so characteristic of the time, and yet not so uncharacteristic
of all times, adds to my satisfaction in presenting Mr. Nathaniel Whiting
with some little more detail than even Brydges has given. (It may be
added that he was deprived of the living at the Restoration. Edward
Price succeeded him on February 20, 1662-3. According to a brief
notice in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> he then migrated to the village of
Cranford, near Kettering, and got together a congregation there. There is no trace
of him in the registers of either of the Cranford churches.<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> The same
authority states that he died childless and was a benefactor of the free
school of Aldwinckle, of which he was master during the period of his
incumbency.)</p>

<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag1"><sup>1</sup></a>
I had written 'nowhere', but hastily. The opening has not a little which convicts
the haste, and I have noted other passages <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote2" name="footnote2"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag2"><sup>2</sup></a>
These oddities of the fifteenth century, with others, were conveniently republished,
in <i>Maccheronee di Cinque Poète Italiani</i> (Milan: D li, 1864).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag3"><sup>3</sup></a>
He would almost be worth republishing for this alone, and I say this despite the
trouble it has given me. Those who are curious in rare words and <i>autoschediastic</i>
forms ought to prize Whiting highly.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote4" name="footnote4"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag4"><sup>4</sup></a>
As an instance here, take the incident where the false Phaeliche, coming to the
nunnery, sees the masons mending the breaches that Rivelezzo's cannon had made.
It is a mere touch, awkward and only half intelligible in the verse. Less than two centuries
later Scott would have given a lively page and a half of prose description of the
scene, with dialogue thrown in. On the other hand, <i>in prose</i>, the extravagances of the
phrase and the incoherences of the story would have had a better chance of being
mended.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote5" name="footnote5"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag5"><sup>5</sup></a>
'Marget' is used in <i>Albino and Bellama</i> as a generic name. But Whiting's
irritable and restless fancy may have put together '<i>Mag-pie</i>' and Persius's <i>poetris pica</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote6" name="footnote6"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag6"><sup>6</sup></a>
By the great kindness of the Rev. J. H. Gray, Tutor and Dean of Queens' College,
assisted by the President of that Society and by the Registrar of the University of
Cambridge, I am enabled to give more than I had found in any book. Nathaniel Whiting
(who seems also to have spelt his name 'Whiteinge' and 'Whitinge') matriculated as
Pensioner on March 30, 1629; proceeded B.A. 1631 and M.A. in 1635. He had been
entered at his college on July 1, 1628, and his tutor's name was Stubbins. In the
College accounts from September 1630, and for four years onwards, Whiting appears as
a Scholar, receiving in the respective years 12s. 6d.; 16s. 3d.; 19s. 7d.; and 15s. 10d.
The first payment seems to have been for part of the year only: but in no year does he
come anywhere near the full income of a Scholar; which, Mr. Gray tells me, seems to
have been £2. There appears to be no subsequent mention of him in the College
records either as Scholar or Fellow.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnote7" name="footnote7"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetag7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Canon Hodgson, Rector of Aldwincle, kindly allowed Mr. Simpson to examine
the registers. The date of Whiting's institution is March 20, 1652, but already in
1650, on May 4, he signs the accounts as 'Minister'.</p>

<p>Some wonder why, some pass it by, some scoff.</p>

<p>3 seq. '<i>Un</i>natural History' was getting past its greatest vogue, and only eight
years later <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i> was to deal it blows all the more deadly because not
unsympathetic. But it was still popular, and a grand set-off to many poetic 'Rascians'.
Whiting is here pilfering from Greene's <i>Pandosto</i>; a passage in the dedication runs,
'The <i>Rascians</i> (right honourable) when by long gazing against the sun, they become
half-blind, recover their sights by looking at the black load-stone. Unicorns, being
glutted, by browsing on roots of liquorice, sharpen their stomachs with crashing
bitter grass'.</p>

to others besides unicorns after a surfeit of liquorice
may be easily admitted. 'Crash' for 'crush' or 'crunch' in this sense is good.</p>

trivial misspellings. Here intelligent 'setting' would of course have made 'But'

<p><i>The Author to his Book.</i>] Most of this wedge-shaped address is clear enough. But
the reader must fit his own sense to '<i>Bee</i> me' (ll. 41-2). Whiting's fantastic wit was
quite Habakkukian in its possibilities.</p>

<p>53 'ermines' here = 'peers or other persons of distinction'.</p>

<p>57 'tilic[k]' = 'linden', from the use of lime-tree bark for paper.</p>

<p>58 Cowlists] Nothing to do (as I at first thought) with Cowley's early vogue, but
one of Whiting's coinages, and frequently repeated <i>infra</i>, for 'monk'. Cf. l. 1945.</p>

<p>79-80 entitle&mdash;stifle] One of those assonances which we have seen frequently in
Marmion, and which were among the rather too numerous licences of mid-seventeenth
century prosody.</p>

<p>88 'crystals' = eyes.</p>

<p>100 deck] = 'pack' as with cards.</p>

<p>102 Whether 'L.' stands merely for 'Love', or whether the 'Signora Inconstanza'
&amp;c. bore the initial, or what else it means, one cannot say. Let us hope that Whiting's
'L.' <i>wore</i> better than Sterne's.</p>

three final lines are different from those of the usual texts, which run:</p>

<p>To fetch in objects, like Bellona's spies,</p>

<p>Pansies, pinks, roses, daffadowndillies.</p>
<p>Nay more, methought, I saw the rubbish way</p>
<p>Sapphires, pearls, rubies, onyx-stones, outray.</p>
<p>The very channel, proud of her blest weight,</p>
<p>Swelled up with pride unto the ridge's height,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>[page&nbsp;473]</span>
<p>To kiss her feet, and made the way an alley.</p>
<p>With this choice fair mine eyes (ah!) once did dally,</p>
<p>Nature's epitome, whose curious brow</p>
<p><span class="right1">1440</span>Was like a smoothèd mount of bleachèd snow,</p>

<p>Two diamonds, which did enlighten all her face.</p>
<p>So that 'twas like those orbs wherein do stray</p>
<p>The planet-lamps, or Cupid's sucking way;</p>
<p>And from these gems such silver rays were sent</p>
<p>Which hatchèd o'er her light accoutrement.</p>

<p>She shot such glorious beams: but now, alas!</p>
<p>She's gone, she's fled, and lo! the mourning grass</p>
<p>Is hayed already, and th' ungemmed stone</p>
<p>At feathers catch to fly where she is gone.</p>
<p>The branchèd beech, the oak, and tow'ring ash,</p>
<p>Bend both their brows and boughs my face to lash.</p>
<p>The angry thorns my hands, though armèd, scratch,</p>
<p>And testy brambles at my vestures catch</p>
<p>(Which was before the curse of human sin,</p>
<p><span class="right1">1460</span>But now, by her, outsmelled the eglantine),</p>

<p>How choicely I have ever honoured her,</p>

<p>149 bean-manors] = Manors held at a bean instead of a peppercorn? Or misprint for
'bea<i>u</i>-manors'? This latter, for 'Beaumanor' is a known name, and Beaumanoir
a better, would be quite like Whiting. My friend Sir Frederick Pollock, to whom
I appealed after a question whether 'bene' in a legal sense was possible, decided that
the phrase could have no technical meaning either as 'bean' or 'bene', but suggested
'rents'. This makes excellent sense, but is not, perhaps, on that account more likely here. <a href="#ab200">Return</a></p>

<p><a name="n800" id="n800"></a>822 I suppose 'flazing' (the original) is only a misprint for 'flaring'; but with
Whiting you can never be quite sure.</p>

<p>829 Orig. 'archy-'.</p>

<p>834 Orig. 'weekes', as in Spenser, <i>F. Q.</i> ii. x. 30, 2.</p>

<p>844 'boat-boy'? Phaon who is mentioned ll. 3582 foll., and whose later stage of beauty

<p><a name="n900" id="n900"></a>904 en-neale] Whiting has used this word before, l. 191, but less oddly. It seems
here to mean 'portray indelibly', 'preserve as in mosaic or enamel'. Cf. l. 1521.</p>

<p>918 Butler, as Brydges noticed, must surely have seen this.</p>

<p>920 That 'Prior' is usual and sufficient did not matter to Whiting: he wanted three
syllables and an easy rhyme, so he made what he wanted.</p>

<p>953 This line settles the question (<i>v. sup.</i>, l. 748) as to Whiting's confusion of
'casket' and 'carcanet'. It is even possible to guess at the cause&mdash;the original French
<i>carcan</i>, 'a prisoner's chain', 'prison' suggesting 'place of confinement'.</p>

<p>975 'Archy-' in original as before. The use of the French corresponding form
'archi-' instead of the English 'arch-' is probably not accidental.</p>

<p>987 The sharp change here from the straightforward 'frosts' &amp;c. to this ellipse of
'as [that] he [should] want' is noticeable.</p>

<p>989-90 Another Dryden suggestion. The improvement in</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">

        <p>The differing titles of the red and white,</p>

<p>is of course immense. But Cambridge poets have always had a laudable habit of
reading each other, and <i>Albino and Bellama</i> was not such a very old poem when
Dryden went up.</p>

<p>998 Original, ridiculously enough, '<i>a</i> A perc<i>ee</i>'! I think Whiting's is the worst

<p><a name="n1000" id="n1000"></a>1004 It is delightful to think how the persons who were shortly to hold Cleveland

her when nobody was looking'!</p>

<p>1027 'Venice' for 'glass'&mdash;'ice'. As I have said, you may do almost anything
you like to Whiting in the way of interpretation.</p>

<p>1058 So, again, I suppose 'vowel-plasters' means 'vocal pleadings', but I should
not dare to be certain.</p>

<p>1068 'Teen', as more than once annotated, = 'light'; so eight lines lower.</p>

<p>1130 Although 'toll' was never (and then less than now) confined to funerals
Whiting had better have used another word.</p>

<p>1155 'Anchorist', is at any rate better than 'Priorist'. Fuller used it later.</p>

<p>1172 If Bellama, who indeed seems to have been an outspoken young lady, had
regarded manners in regard to her love as little as Agamemnon in regard to his wife,
she might have told him that his verses were rather long. <a href="#ab1200">Return</a></p>

<p>1214 'frank', again Shakespearian, is of course proper to the boar only; but
Whiting did not regard invidious distinctions.</p>

<p>1244 There is, of course, not the slightest justification for 'rosy', but our poet was
<i>supra</i> not merely <i>grammaticam</i> but <i>vocabularium</i> and everything else.</p>

<p>1271 An odd and rather awkward metaphor.</p>

<p><a name="n1300" id="n1300"></a>1306 Does 'wretch<i>ing</i>' occur elsewhere? 'Wretch' as a verb is quoted, but only
as Scots, and only in the sense of 'be miserly'. Whiting, though not muddle-headed,
was so feather-headed in the use of words that one must take into account the
possibility of '<i>r</i>etching', i.e. 'vomiting blasphemy', and can hardly neglect as <i>im</i>possible
a careless confusion with 'wretch<i>less</i>, = 'reckless'.</p>

<p>1340 The poet changes number from 'nips' to 'uncrown' with his usual lightness

stage, as well as in Brome's <i>Northern Lass</i>, &amp;c. on it.</p>

<p>1521 Here 'en-nealed' throws its light backward on the use <i>supra</i> (l. 904) as simply
'enamelled'.</p>

<p>3582 seq. The story of Aphrodite and her gift to Phao is vulgate, but the goddess's

'Sea's' or (more nearly) 'Se<i>d</i>'s'. The latter is a clear <i>vox nihili</i>, and as, I suppose,
even Nathaniel Whiting in the height of his pranks would not make 'Se-a' a dissyllable,

preceded Whiting's restless and fantastic ingenuity in making a half English half Latin

numerous senses of 'lug' meaning 'protuberances'. So I suppose 'ludgets' are
knobs or lumps of bread. But to tell the truth the description of this meal requires
nearly as strong a stomach to read as the meal itself to eat, and I shall say little more
of it. Naughtiness is sometimes (though by no means so necessarily as appears to
some authors and critics) amusing: nastiness never is. I shall therefore take the
liberty of not annotating for a page or two.</p>

<p>3796 This line would be a good text for a discourse on the type of writing. 'Blur
the holier entries of Albino's page with the recording Angel' is its equivalent, and
there have been times when that would have been approved as '<i>w</i>ery pretty'. But
'roule' in orig. may be a misprint for 'soule'.</p>

<p>3797 'Venice' and 'Venus' have been played upon before by the writer: they are
probably, but not quite necessarily, interchanged here by the printer. It may perhaps
be noted that in the original the printer, weary of mere misspelling and misprinting,
has taken to mispaging. The text goes on straight, but the pages after 129 are
numbered 26, 12, 132, 133, 130, 131, 136, 137, 134, 135, 140, 141, and so on. <a href="#ab3800">Return</a></p>

<p>3967 'Copester' (orig. 'coapster') here, and 'coped' ('coap't') in l. 4032, have
nothing to do with the amorous sense in which the word has been formerly used.

<p> 4122 If anybody asks where Starley is it will be sufficient to answer that it is where
the Danes used cannons. But 'act their juries' (if right) is one of those at first sight

<p>A pregnant-witted bard did silence break.</p>
<p><span class="right1">200</span>Homer 'twas not, he could not see to speak.</p>
<p>Virgil it was not, he had got a wrench:</p>
<p>Nor B. nor M., for they had got a wench.</p>
<p>Ennius was lame, and much did fear his shins;</p>
<p>Horace was busy with the kilderkins,</p>
<p>Ovid employed with his belovèd flea,</p>
<p>Old Geoffrey's language was not fit for plea.</p>
<p>Drayton on 's brains a new Moon-calf was getting,</p>

<p>I knew the Roscian's feature, not his name;</p>
<p><span class="right1">210</span>Yet 'tis engraven on the shawm of Fame.</p>
<p>With settled grace he boldly did advance:</p>
<p>'Father of gods! King of the large expanse!</p>
<p>We oft have heard proud Envy belching forth</p>
<p>Fogs, mists, and fumes, t' eclipse the metric worth,</p>
<p>And know the teeming world did never nurse</p>
<p>So great a mischief as the critic curse.</p>
<p>Our souls one minute have not rested quiet</p>
<p>Since carps, we know, was <i>Ignoramus</i>' diet.</p>
<p>If Wisdom's fetial call to the sand</p>

<p>That rights our wrongs: but 'gainst Don Silly's rails</p>
<p>The fist is heaved, for paper naught avails.</p>
<p>We sate in counsel, did intend to sue</p>
<p>With a petition to this noble crew;</p>
<p>The substance this, that ye would either give</p>
<p>Wit and discretion unto all that live,</p>
<p>Or make them idiots, deprived of reason.</p>
<p>Else, but to speak, let it be counted treason.</p>
<p>But we appeal, great gods, 'tis now my theme&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="right1">230</span>To clear from mud pure Aganippa's stream,</p>
<p>Assist, Pierides, maintain your fires</p>
<p>With greater care than can the Vestals theirs;</p>

<p>And wreathe the Muses' brows with diadems.</p>
<p>Methinks this draught such virtue does infuse</p>

<p>A spirit of valour to ungod great war,</p>
<p>Should he but send a ram, but to the bar;</p>
<p>Who knows not Vaticinium does imply</p>
<p>In equal measures verse and prophecy,</p>
<p>An inspiration, a celestial touch?</p>
<p>Such is the poet's raptures, prophet's such.</p>
<p><i>Vates</i>, a bard, and him that does presage;</p>
<p><i>Vaticinor</i>, possessed with either rage.</p>
<p><i>Poema</i> is a book, in numbers framed,</p>
<p><span class="right1">250</span>Fast cémented with sense, by working named,</p>
<p>To which the choicest orator stands bare.</p>
<p><i>Poesis</i> does, in a sublimer air,</p>
<p>Things human and divine expose to view.</p>
<p>The first philosophy that Fame e'er knew</p>
<p>Was honoured with the name of Poetry,</p>
<p>Enriched with rules of pure morality,</p>
<p>Reading instructions unto heathen men.</p>
<p>With more contentment than the Stoic's pen.</p>
<p>The ancients unto poets only gave</p>
<p><span class="right1">260</span>The epithets of wise, divine, and grave;</p>
<p>Because their metres taught the world to know</p>
<p>To whom they did their holy worship owe.</p>
<p>The Greek is free, and kinder in her praise</p>
<p>Which she bestows upon poetic lays.</p>
<p>She calls all that which takes not essence by</p>
<p>A matter pre-existent, poesy.</p>
<p>So makes the world a poem: and by this</p>
<p>The great creator a great poet is.</p>
<p>Nay more, that language on the Nine bestows</p>
<p><span class="right1">270</span>(As ev'ry callent of that idiom knows</p>

<p>The steps of Nature, human and divine,</p>

<p>Unlock the <i>exta</i> of each science, art,</p>
<p>By cunning search; again, not as a part,</p>
<p>Nor a grand column only, but entreasures</p>
<p>The soul of learning in the poet's measures.</p>
<p>All other arts (which use and learning gave)</p>

<p>Whenas the poet's pen alone 's inspired,</p>
<p>With high enthusiasms by heaven fired,</p>
<p>Ennius them holy calls; and Plato says</p>
<p>Furies divine are in the poet's lays.</p>
<p>Nor wanted he himself the poet's wit;</p>
<p>He <i>Dithyrambos</i> and love passions writ.</p>
<p>The Regal Prophet was a true-born poet,</p>
<p>As to the life his well-tuned metres show it;</p>
<p>Composed to music by that holy man,</p>
<p><span class="right1">290</span>Ere Hopkins and Sternhold knew how to scan.</p>
<p>Hence, chicken-augurs, with your crooked staves,</p>
<p>Whose rash conjectures crown and dig us graves.</p>
<p>A lofty fancy, steepèd in the fount</p>
<p>Of Pegasus, an higher pitch can mount.</p>
<p>Sibylline oracles did speak in verse;</p>
<p>Their scattered leaves in measures did rehearse</p>
<p>The mysteries of man's redemption by</p>
<p>The incarnation of a deity.</p>
<p>Grave Maro, I remember, in an ode</p>
<p><span class="right1">300</span>(An eclogue) treads the same prophetic road.</p>
<p>Those famous <i>Druides</i>, renowned of late,</p>
<p>Treated at large o' th' soul's immortal state.</p>
<p>Man's spirit does not to the gloomy shade</p>
<p>Of <i>Erebus</i>, o'er black <i>Cocytus</i>, wade.</p>
<p>Death sets no period, is the lesser part</p>
<p>Of human life; for the same breath does dart</p>
<p>Vigour to every sinew in the bulk.</p>
<p>Man lives as freely in another hulk.</p>
<p>Who readeth Ovid's Metamorphosin,</p>
<p><span class="right1">310</span>And thinks not Moses' soul was sheathèd in</p>
<p>His body by a transmigration?</p>
<p>He from the chaos tells the world's plantation.</p>
<p>Maro accords, and gives the world a soul</p>
<p>Which does this well-compacted lump control;</p>
<p>And by illumination he discovered</p>
<p>How then the spirit o'er the water hovered.</p>
<p>Th' inspirèd pen of old Pythagoras</p>
<p>By <i>Naso's</i> guide relates how in this mass</p>
<p>All things do alter shape, yet soon Dame Nature</p>
<p><span class="right1">320</span>Of one form lost informs another feature.</p>
<p>No substance 's nothingèd in this large globe,</p>
<p>But 'gainst some feast puts on a newer robe.</p>
<p>The earth, resolved to water, rarefies</p>
<p>Into pure air; the thinner water flies;</p>
<p>The purer air assumes a scorching heat.</p>
<p>They, back returning, orderly retreat:</p>
<p>Those subtle sparks converted are to breath,</p>
<p>The spissy air, being doomed unto death,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>[page&nbsp;548]</span>
<p>Turns into sea, earth's made a thick'ned water.</p>
<p><span class="right1">330</span>Thus wily Nature is a strange translator.</p>
<p>(My lady readers I refer to Sandys,</p>
<p>But the grave learnèd unto Ovid's hands.)</p>
<p>Nor Seneca divine wants prophesies.</p>
<p>Near to the death of time, an age shall rise</p>
<p>In which says he, the ocean shall untie</p>
<p>The wat'ry bands of things and to the eye</p>
<p>Of Tiphys, a new world appear</p>
<p>Unheard before by the most itching ear,</p>
<p>In glory matching this. Then Thule no more</p>
<p><span class="right1">340</span>Shall be th' earth's <i>ne plus ultra</i> bound or door,</p>
<p>Our eights i' th' hundred would large heaps of treasures</p>
<p>Set in their wills to buy Zorastus' measures.</p>
<p>Mass-priests for dirges then would lose their fee;</p>
<p>These would the surest <i>de profundis</i> be.</p>
<p>Shopsters and gallants to his house would hop</p>
<p>More than t' exchanges or canary-shop.</p>
<p>And poets brisk would have a larger dealth,</p>
<p>Than holy confessors of dead men's wealth.</p>
<p>I might be infinite, should I but show</p>
<p><span class="right1">350</span>For what grave arts the world to poets owe.</p>
<p>Apelles had not been without Parnasse,</p>
<p>The pencil's worth had only dwelt on glass,</p>
<p>Or dusty tablets, guided by those apes,</p>
<p>In imitation of some antic shapes.</p>
<p>Venus a portrait had, Pygmalion missed</p>
<p>That speechless female which he hugged and kissed.</p>
<p>Had not th' enlivening breath of poetry</p>
<p>T' a higher pitch reared up dull fantasy.</p>
<p>How quickly worthy acts of famous men</p>
<p><span class="right1">360</span>Died in the wane of our poetic pen!</p>
<p>How rudely by the monks (which only had</p>
<p>The key of learning) were their actions clad!</p>
<p>King Ethelbert's closed in his Polyander,</p>
<p>To Christ for church buildings he's gone without meander.</p>
<p>Such stuff the tombs of Bede and Petrarch have,</p>
<p>The razor from all monky pates did shave</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>[page&nbsp;549]</span>
<p>Wit with their hair, except in Mantuan.</p>
<p>Re-teined by Vida and Politian,</p>
<p>And many others was this glorious sun,</p>
<p><span class="right1">370</span>Which glitter shall till earth's last thread be spun.</p>
<p>We raise shall obelisks by Apollo's breath,</p>
<p>Which owe no homage to the rage of death.</p>
<p>By pen Honterus creatures limned to life,</p>
<p>Better than could the cynic with his knife.</p>
<p>Pliny comparèd unto him did err;</p>
<p>He was a chemic and cosmographer.</p>
<p>How bravely does the Scottish bard depinge</p>
<p>The planets' order and the spheric hinge!</p>
<p>Brave Petrarch, latined by our learned clerk,</p>
<p><span class="right1">380</span>Lights us a lamp to guide us in this dark. </p>
<p>And critic age says that stout Alexander,</p>
<p>(Whose warlike steps o'er all this globe did wander)</p>
<p>Fixing on brave Pelides' tomb his eye,</p>
<p>Rapt with a noble envy loud did cry,</p>
<p>'Happy, O happy thou! whole actions still</p>
<p>Live, being enbreathed by the immortal quill</p>
<p>Of worthy Homer!' nay, when his sword had gained</p>
<p>Those wealthy realms o'er which Darius reigned,</p>
<p>He 'mongst his treasures found a casket fair,</p>
<p><span class="right1">390</span>So set with gold and gems it rayed the air,</p>
<p>And called in day despite of clouds or nights&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet the best use (as grave Patricius writes)</p>
<p>This cabinet could serve to, was t' entomb</p>
<p>Homer's choice Iliads in his glorious womb.</p>
<p>Of Zoarastus now some wonders hear,</p>
<p>And barrel his disciples in thine ear,</p>
<p>Whose rhymes could charm foul Cerber's bawling tongue,</p>
<p>And pick hell's lock with his enchanting song;</p>
<p>From Stygian shade conducting whom they listed,</p>
<p><span class="right1">400</span>And whom they pleased with hellish fogs bemisted.</p>
<p>Oh golden metres, rhymes outworthing gold,</p>
<p>At what high prices would they now be sold</p>
<p>If they were extant! friend for friend would sell</p>
<p>Lordships, books, banners, to redeem from hell.</p>
<p>How many ages has those Greeks survived</p>
<p>(Than all their predecessors longer lived),</p>
<p>Which showed their noble worths at Ilium's grave?</p>
<p>Yet thrice Nestorean age them Homer gave.</p>
<p>How bravely Lucan tells succeeding ages</p>
<p><span class="right1">410</span>The seven-hillèd city's bloody rages!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>[page&nbsp;550]</span>
<p>Moist clouds long since have washed the purpled grass,</p>
<p>Yet red as ever 'tis in Lucan's glass.</p>
<p>To Carthage' Queen the wand'ring Trojan prince</p>
<p>Pretended love, but dead it is long since,</p>
<p>And dust are they; yet Virgil's lofty verse</p>
<p>Makes him speak wars, she love, from under th' hearse.</p>
<p>Long since did Hellespont gulp in Leander,</p>
<p>When he presumed on naked breast to wander.</p>
<p>Hero's watch-candle's out; they vanished quite.</p>
<p><span class="right1">420</span>Yet Ovid says all was but yesternight.</p>
<p>A great while since the cheating miller stole</p>
<p>The scholars' meal by a quadruple toll:</p>
<p>They gave him th' hornbook, taught his daughter Greek,</p>
<p>Yet look in Chaucer&mdash;done the other week.</p>
<p>Ir'n-sinewed Talus with his steely flail</p>
<p>Long since i' th' right of justice did prevail</p>
<p>Under the sceptre of the Fairy Queen:</p>
<p>Yet Spenser's lofty measures makes it green.</p>
<p>Donne was a poet and a grave divine,</p>
<p><span class="right1">430</span>Highly esteemèd for the sacred Nine</p>
<p>That aftertimes shall say whilst there's a sun</p>
<p>'This verse, this sermon, was composed by Dun'.</p>
<p>What by heroic acts to man accrues,</p>
<p>When grisly Charon for his waftage sues,</p>
<p>If his great grandchild, and his grandchild's son,</p>
<p>May not the honours, which his sword hath won,</p>
<p>Read, graved on paper by a poet's pen,</p>
<p>When marble monuments are dust, and when</p>
<p>Time has eat off his paint and lettered gold;</p>
<p><span class="right1">440</span>For verse alone keeps honour out o' th' mould?</p>
<p>The press successively gives birth to verse,</p>
<p>Shall steely tombs outlive the buckram hearse?</p>
<p>To other things the same proportion hold</p>
<p>Pure rhymes which lofty volumes do enfold.</p>
<p>Autumnal frosts would nip the double rose,</p>
<p>If cherish'd only by the breath of prose.</p>
<p>Beauty of beauty's not the smallest part</p>
<p>Which is bestowèd by our liberal art.</p>
<p>Orpheus, Arion, and the scraping crew,</p>
<p><span class="right1">450</span>To wire and parchèd guts may bid adieu,</p>
<p>Or audience beg; were 't not for sprightful bays,</p>
<p>Which to the strings composeth merry lays.</p>
<p>But with the Muses I'm so fall'n in love</p>
<p>That I forget thy presence, mighty Jove!</p>
<p>And through the spacious universe do walk:</p>
<p>But this shall set a period to my talk.'</p>
<p>Jove stretch'd his sceptre then, with frolic grace,</p>
<p>And joy triumphèd on the heaven's face.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>[page&nbsp;551]</span>
<p>The orbs made music, and the planets danced:</p>
<p><span class="right1">460</span>The Muses' glory was by all enhanced.</p>
<p>Jove then intended for to ratify</p>
<p>Decrees in the behoof of poesy,</p>
<p>Giving the bards his hand to kiss; and made</p>
<p>Chaplets of laurel which should never fade.</p>
<p>But Vulcan, to Gradive placed in oppose,</p>
<p>Was nodding fast and bellowing through the nose.</p>
<p>His armèd brow fell down; and lighting right</p>
<p>His antlers did the marching god unsight.</p>
<p>Mars fumed, the gods laughed out, the spheres did shake,</p>
<p><span class="right1">470</span>At which shrill noise I starting did awake,</p>
<p>And looking up (East having oped his doors)</p>
<p>Amazèd I beheld a troop of scores,</p>
<p>And wond'ring, thought they'd been ale-debts, but found</p>
<p>I them had chalkèd in my dreaming swound.</p>
<p>I trow not the decree: 'twas Vulcan's fault&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet dreams are seldom sound, like him they halt.</p>
<p>Take this: and, if I can so happy be,</p>
<p>I'll write, in my next slumbers, the decree.</p>

<p><i>Il Insonio Insonnadado</i>] 13 The names taken from the well-known passage of Ovid,
<i>Met.</i> xi. 640 seq.</p>

<p>37 Galupin?</p>

<p>38 goddy kin. Read perhaps 'goddykin', on the analogy of 'mannikin', and
interpret of Ganymede. On the other hand Whiting affects there adjectives in -<i>y</i>: see
the examples quoted, <i>Albino</i>, l. 808, where 'goddy' actually occurs.</p>

<p>76 Orig. 'da<i>v</i>e'. 'Have' seems more likely, but therefore perhaps less Whitingish,
than 'dare'.</p>

<p>86 terse] 'polished'. Cf. <i>Albino</i>, 3329.</p>

<p>88 Orig. 'rithming'. This generally = 'rhyming' but may = 'rhythming'.</p>

<p>108 <i>aio</i>'s] = Latin 'I say it'. For similar plurals, cf. <i>conclusum</i>'s in <i>Albino</i>, 1334,
and <i>fortasse</i>'s, 2488.</p>

<p>191 double Beaumont] Francis and Sir John. The mention of Drummond is interesting,
for I do not remember many.</p>

<p>198 I do not remember many 'plays' on that consonance of 'rime' and 'rhyme'
which is a main argument for not confusing the spelling. In previous line orig. 'fleezie'.</p>

<p>202 I suppose 'M.' is Martial: which of the B.'s (it is surely not Boethius?) the
other letter libels I know not.</p>

<p>205 Ovid] The allusion is to the spurious <i>De Pulice</i> printed in the early editions of
Ovid.</p>

<p>209 If people read Whiting I suppose somebody would say that this 'Roscian'
must be Shakespeare.</p>

<p>218 Ruggles's almost famous play had been written a quarter of a century and performed
before the King more than twenty years earlier, but it had only been printed
in 1630.</p>

<p>219 'fetial' (orig. 'fæcial') = the priest-herald-ambassador who delivered the
ultimatum of war or proclaimed peace. 'Sand' = arena.</p>

<p>236 Colocassian] = made of the great leaves of the Egyptian water-lily.</p>

<p>249 Here we get into the old critical commonplaces of the Italians as to Poema,
Poesis, &amp;c.</p>

<p>270 callent] = 'knower'. Whether Whitings invention I know not: he might
in the context have been directly thinking of Pliny's 'vaticinandi callentes'.</p>

<p>275 exta = 'entrails', not merely as 'inwards' 'secrets', but as possessing
indications for haruspices.</p>

<p>290 Hopkins and Sternhold: cf. <i>sup.</i>, King, p. 228.</p>

<p>331 Orig. has simply 'sands' (the proper pronunciation) with a small <i>s</i>. Sandys's
<i>Ovid</i> was extremely popular.</p>

<p>337 Orig. 'Typhis'. Tethys? as in the passage of Seneca's <i>Medea</i>, to which
Whiting refers ('Tethys novos deteget orbes'). But Tiphys, the helmsman of the
Argonauts, and watcher of the seas, may be meant: cf. the prominence given to him
in Virgil's 4th Eclogue, 'Alter erit tum Tiphys'.</p>

<p>342 Zorastus] Spelt '<i>Zoarastus</i>' in l. 395. The reference is to the reputed oracles
of Zoroaster, printed in <i>Magia Philosophica, hoc est Francisci Patricii Summi Philosophi
Zoroaster &amp; eius 320 Oracula Chaldaica</i>, Hamburg, 1593. Patrizzi, whose <i>Della
Poetica</i> (Ferrara, 1586) ranks high in Renaissance criticism, is named at l. 392.</p>

<p>363 Polyander]?</p>

<p>364 Whether this overflowing line is a flirt of Whiting's heels or a slip of pen or
press may be doubtful.</p>

<p>368 Re-teined. Cf. the dedication to <i>Albino</i>, l. 6.</p>

<p>373 Honterus] Author of <i>Cosmographiae Rudimenta</i>, 1534, several revisions or
re-issues of which appeared in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>373-393 These lines are full of allusions which I cannot exactly interpret. In fact
the whole poem, evidently suggested in style by Marston, Tourneur, and others, is
a sort of mystification.</p>

<p>432 Orig. 'Dun'. One of the commonest spellings, and apparently the usual
pronunciation.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Madam, 'tis true</i> is printed in Jonson's <i>Underwoods</i> (1640, p. 247),
where it opens <i>Fair Friend, 'tis true</i>, and follows <i>A New-Year's Gift sung to
King Charles, 1635</i>. Godolphin's Commendatory Poem to Sandys's <i>Paraphrase of
the Divine Poems</i>, 1648, was accidentally omitted from this collection: but
as it is easily accessible, it has not been thought necessary to reprint it among
these <i>Errata</i>.</p>

<h4>Transcriber's Note:<a name="end" id="end"></a></h4>

<p>Tables of Contents have been added to two of the books, where they were only present in the initial List of Contents.</p>

<p>In the original, the Commendatory Poems were printed in two columns, and the line numbers were placed convenient
to the length of line, occasionally 29, 41, etc. Since all the poems are now in single column format, the line numbers
in the Commendatory Poems have been restored to the usual 30, 40, etc.</p>

<p>At the time of the Caroline Period, England still followed the Julian calendar (after Julius Caesar, 44 B.C.),
and celebrated New Year's Day on March 25th (Annunciation Day). Most Catholic countries accepted the Gregorian calendar
(after Pope Gregory XIII) from some time after 1582 (the Catholic countries of France, Spain, Portugal,
and Italy in 1582, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland within a year or two, Hungary in 1587, and Scotland in 1600),
and celebrated New Year's Day on January 1st. England finally changed to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.</p>

<p>This is the reason for the double dates in the early months of the years in some of the Notes. There is a reference on page 415 to
28th December, 1682, followed by a reference to January 28th, 1682/3. (1682 in England; 1683 in Scotland).
Only after March 25th (Julian New Years Day) was the year the same in the two countries. The Julian calendar was known as 'Old Style',
and the Gregorian calendar as 'New Style' (N.S.).</p>
